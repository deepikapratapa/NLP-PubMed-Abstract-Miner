40747162,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Renal Abscess Unmasks Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in an Adolescent: A Case Report.,"Renal abscesses are rare in children. This report presents a case where a renal abscess due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the initial indication of immunocompromised status in an adolescent boy. A 17-year-old male patient presented with a month-long history of fever, fatigue, and significant weight loss, along with dull aches and swelling in the left flank. There was no history of urinary symptoms, vomiting, or high-risk behaviors. His mother had died from sepsis while on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and his father from coronary artery disease. The patient had not been previously tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Examination revealed a tender fullness in the left lumbar region. Ultrasound showed a collection in the left kidney. Blood tests indicated anemia and elevated inflammatory markers. The patient tested positive for HIV antibodies. Empirical antibiotics were started. Ultrasound-guided aspiration grew MRSA, prompting a switch to vancomycin. A percutaneous catheter was inserted due to abscess recurrence. The patient received intravenous vancomycin followed by oral linezolid and started antiretroviral therapy. Repeat imaging at six weeks showed resolution of the abscess. Renal abscesses in children can be life-threatening and often result from urinary tract infections or hematogenous spread. This patient's abscess likely resulted from hematogenous spread due to immunocompromised status. Effective management, including prompt percutaneous drainage and targeted antibiotics, combined with ART, led to abscess resolution and a favorable outcome. This case underscores the importance of considering immunodeficiency in pediatric patients with unusual infections like renal abscesses and highlights the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach and aggressive management for complex infections in immunocompromised children.",2025 Jul,"['renal abscesses', 'children', 'report', 'case', 'renal abscess', 'methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus', 'mrsa', 'indication', 'immunocompromised status', 'adolescent', 'boy', 'male', 'patient', 'month-long history', 'fever', 'fatigue', 'significant', 'weight loss', 'dull aches', 'swelling', 'left flank', 'urinary symptoms', 'vomiting', 'high-risk behaviors', 'mother', 'died', 'sepsis', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'art', 'father', 'coronary artery disease', 'patient', 'human immunodeficiency virus', 'hiv', 'examination', 'tender fullness', 'left lumbar region', 'ultrasound', 'collection', 'left kidney', 'blood tests', 'anemia', 'elevated', 'inflammatory', 'markers', 'patient', 'positive', 'hiv antibodies', 'empirical', 'antibiotics', 'ultrasound-guided', 'aspiration', 'mrsa', 'switch', 'vancomycin', 'percutaneous catheter', 'abscess', 'recurrence', 'patient', 'intravenous', 'oral', 'linezolid', 'started', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'imaging', 'weeks', 'resolution', 'abscess', 'renal abscesses', 'children', 'life-threatening', 'urinary tract infections', 'hematogenous', 'spread', ""patient's"", 'abscess', 'hematogenous', 'spread', 'immunocompromised status', 'effective management', 'percutaneous drainage', 'targeted antibiotics', 'combined', 'art', 'abscess', 'resolution', 'favorable outcome', 'immunodeficiency', 'pediatric', 'patients', 'infections', 'renal abscesses', 'multidisciplinary approach', 'aggressive management', 'complex infections', 'immunocompromised children']",[]
40746790,Diverse Manifestations of Central Nervous System Tuberculosis: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Presentations and Laboratory Investigations in a Cohort Study.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate and characterize the diverse MRI findings in central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis (TB) and the role of other laboratory investigations to aid in early detection and appropriate management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study analyzed clinical and imaging data from 43 patients with confirmed CNS TB. The diagnosis was confirmed through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, biopsy, or clinical and radiological improvement post-antitubercular therapy (ATT). MRI findings were categorized into meningeal and parenchymal forms, with further subtyping based on lesion characteristics. Chi-square statistics were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) to correlate CNS TB with clinical parameters.  Results: The mean age of the 43 patients was 33 years, and 58% were male. The most common clinical symptoms were headache (86%) and fever (79%). MRI findings revealed meningeal TB (leptomeningitis and pachymeningitis) and parenchymal TB (tuberculomas, tubercular abscesses, cerebritis, rhombencephalitis, and encephalopathy). Frequent observations included ring-enhancing lesions and perilesional edema. Parenchymal tuberculomas showed varying stages. Advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion imaging were useful in differentiating tuberculomas from neoplastic and infectious differentials. CONCLUSION: CNS TB presents with diverse MRI patterns, including both typical and atypical manifestations. Accurate radiological assessment, combined with clinical correlation, is essential for early diagnosis and management. Prompt initiation of ATT is critical in preventing long-term neurological complications. Future research should focus on refining imaging biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy.",2025 Jun,"['objectives', 'study', 'evaluate', 'characterize', 'diverse', 'mri', 'findings', 'central nervous system', 'laboratory investigations', 'early detection', 'appropriate', 'management', 'retrospective', 'cross-sectional study', 'clinical', 'imaging', 'data', 'patients', 'cns tb', 'diagnosis', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'csf', 'biopsy', 'clinical', 'radiological', 'post-antitubercular therapy', 'att', 'mri', 'findings', 'meningeal', 'parenchymal forms', 'subtyping', 'lesion', 'characteristics', 'chi-square statistics', 'ibm spss statistics', 'windows', 'armonk', 'new york', 'united states', 'cns', 'clinical', 'parameters', 'age', 'patients', 'years', 'male', 'clinical symptoms', 'headache', 'fever', 'mri', 'findings', 'meningeal tb', 'leptomeningitis', 'pachymeningitis', 'parenchymal tb', 'tuberculomas', 'tubercular abscesses', 'cerebritis', 'rhombencephalitis', 'encephalopathy', 'frequent', 'observations', 'ring-enhancing lesions', 'perilesional edema', 'parenchymal tuberculomas', 'stages', 'advanced imaging techniques', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'perfusion imaging', 'tuberculomas', 'neoplastic', 'infectious differentials', 'cns', 'diverse', 'mri', 'patterns', 'typical', 'atypical', 'manifestations', 'radiological assessment', 'clinical correlation', 'early diagnosis', 'management', 'prompt', 'initiation', 'att', 'long-term', 'neurological complications', 'research', 'imaging', 'biomarkers', 'diagnostic accuracy']",['United States']
40742524,Anti-chikungunya Activity of a Cinnamic Acid Derivative: An In Vitro and In Silico Study.,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus that causes debilitating joint pain and fever with limited treatment options. Cinnamic acid, known for its broad-spectrum biological activities, and its derivatives were evaluated for their potential antiviral effects against CHIKV. In vitro experiments assessed the cytotoxicity of cinnamic acid and its derivatives and their efficacy in inhibiting CHIKV under different treatment settings. Additionally, molecular docking of the effective compounds with CHIKV proteins was performed to determine the probable targets. The results indicated that the derivative CATD-3, a 3,6-(substituted phenyl)-(1,2,4) triazolo [3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazole compound, showed antiviral activity under post-infection treatment conditions in Vero CCL-81 cells. The dose-dependent studies revealed that the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 11.49 microM and the selectivity index of CATD-3 was 13.39. The antiviral activity of CATD-3 was also observed in HeLa cells. In-silico studies revealed that the CATD-3 binds multiple non-structural proteins (nsP) i.e., nsP1, nsP2, and nsP4 of the virus with good binding energies and forming strong interactions with conserved residues on nsP1 methyl transferase (Val 129, Tyr 130, Ala 131) and nsP2 helicase (Met 91, Met 289, and Thr 261) and critical residues of the nsP4 RdRp (Arg331 and Asp 350). The combined in vitro and in silico studies underscores the therapeutic potential of cinnamic acid derivative, CATD-3, as a promising antiviral candidate against CHIKV.",2025 Jul 31,"['chikungunya virus', 'chikv', 'arthropod-borne virus', 'debilitating', 'joint pain', 'fever', 'treatment options', 'cinnamic acid', 'broad-spectrum biological activities', 'derivatives', 'evaluated', 'potential', 'antiviral effects', 'chikv', 'in vitro', 'experiments', 'assessed', 'cytotoxicity', 'cinnamic acid', 'derivatives', 'efficacy', 'inhibiting', 'chikv', 'treatment settings', 'molecular docking', 'effective', 'compounds', 'chikv', 'proteins', 'targets', 'results', 'derivative', 'catd-3', '3,6-(substituted phenyl)-(1,2,4) triazolo', 'antiviral activity', 'post-infection', 'treatment conditions', 'vero ccl-81 cells', 'dose-dependent', 'inhibitory', 'ic50', 'selectivity index', 'catd-3', 'antiviral activity', 'catd-3', 'hela', 'cells', 'in-silico studies', 'catd-3', 'binds', 'multiple', 'nsp1', 'nsp2', 'nsp4', 'virus', 'binding energies', 'interactions', 'conserved residues', 'nsp1 methyl transferase', 'tyr', 'ala 131)', 'nsp2 helicase', 'met', 'met', 'thr', 'critical residues', 'nsp4 rdrp', 'arg331', 'asp', 'in vitro', 'in silico studies', 'therapeutic', 'potential', 'cinnamic acid derivative', 'catd-3', 'antiviral candidate', 'chikv']",[]
40742003,Paradoxical Hemoglobin Drop Post-Transfusion: Hyperhemolysis in Delta-Beta Thalassemia with Macrophage Activation Syndrome.,"Hyperhaemolysis syndrome (HHS) is a rare, severe complication of transfusion characterised by a paradoxical drop in haemoglobin (Hb) levels post-transfusion, often below pre-transfusion values. Most reported cases are in patients with sickle cell disease and it has been rarely reported in other haemoglobinopathies. We report a case of HHS in a newly diagnosed delta-beta thalassaemia patient, manifesting as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), successfully managed with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), corticosteroids, rituximab, and erythropoietin. A 19-year-old female presented with fever, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly three weeks after a blood transfusion. Investigations revealed microcytic anaemia, elevated LDH and indirect bilirubin, and HPLC findings suggestive of delta-beta thalassaemia. She developed haemolysis and a paradoxical Hb drop after subsequent transfusions, along with reticulocytopenia. Alloimmunisation was initially absent but anti-E and anti-K antibodies were subsequently detected. Despite antigen-matched transfusions, haemolysis persisted, raising suspicion for HHS. She was managed with IVIG, methylprednisolone, erythropoietin, and rituximab, resulting in initial improvement in haemoglobin levels, which subsequently declined again. She then developed fever and leukocytosis without evidence of infection, and a high HScore raised suspicion for macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Dexamethasone was initiated, leading to defervescence, normalisation of the reticulocyte count, and a significant rise in haemoglobin. She was discharged in stable condition and remained well at 6-month follow-up. This case highlights hyperhaemolysis syndrome (HHS) as a potential complication in patients with haemoglobinopathies. Although its exact pathogenesis remains unclear, macrophage activation appears to play an important role. Early recognition and timely initiation of appropriate immunotherapy can lead to favourable outcomes.",2025 Jul 31,"['hyperhaemolysis syndrome', 'hhs', 'rare', 'severe', 'complication', 'transfusion', 'characterised', 'paradoxical', 'haemoglobin', 'post-transfusion', 'pre-transfusion', 'cases', 'patients', 'sickle cell disease', 'haemoglobinopathies', 'case', 'hhs', 'diagnosed', 'delta-beta thalassaemia', 'patient', 'manifesting', 'macrophage activation syndrome', 'mas', 'intravenous immunoglobulin (', 'ivig', 'corticosteroids', 'rituximab', 'erythropoietin', 'female', 'fever', 'jaundice', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'weeks', 'blood transfusion', 'investigations', 'microcytic anaemia', 'elevated', 'ldh', 'indirect', 'bilirubin', 'hplc', 'findings', 'delta-beta thalassaemia', 'haemolysis', 'paradoxical', 'drop', 'transfusions', 'reticulocytopenia', 'alloimmunisation', 'absent', 'anti-e', 'anti-k', 'antibodies', 'detected', 'antigen-matched transfusions', 'haemolysis', 'suspicion', 'hhs', 'ivig', 'methylprednisolone', 'erythropoietin', 'rituximab', 'improvement', 'haemoglobin', 'levels', 'declined', 'fever', 'leukocytosis', 'evidence', 'infection', 'hscore', 'suspicion', 'macrophage activation syndrome', 'mas', 'dexamethasone', 'defervescence', 'normalisation', 'reticulocyte', 'significant', 'haemoglobin', 'discharged', 'stable', 'condition', 'follow-up', 'hyperhaemolysis syndrome', 'hhs', 'complication', 'patients', 'haemoglobinopathies', 'pathogenesis', 'unclear', 'macrophage', 'early recognition', 'initiation', 'immunotherapy']",['Mali']
40741554,Clinico-Epidemiological Profile of Dengue in Children of Age Group 0-14 Years Admitted in a Tertiary Care Hospital.,"Background Dengue has emerged as the most common arboviral infection in India and worldwide. Dengue presents with a varied clinical spectrum in different age groups. The changing epidemiology and presentation are a challenge for early diagnosis and management. This prospective observational study aimed to determine the epidemiological profile of hospitalized dengue-positive children aged 0-14 years and correlate their clinical and hematological profiles. Methodology One hundred and five children with laboratory-confirmed dengue were enrolled in this study over a six-month study period. They were categorized into severe and non-severe dengue according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Detailed clinical examination and laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver enzymes, coagulation profile, and imaging (chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound), were performed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. Results Out of the total 105 cases, 90 children (85.7%) had non-severe dengue and only 15 (14.3%) had severe dengue. The mean age of children was 92.02 months, with a male predominance (72, 68.6%). The most commonly identified symptoms were fever (105, 100%), vomiting (47, 44.76%), and abdominal pain (46, 43.81%). It was found that although thrombocytopenia was seen in 79 children (75.2%), it was not significantly associated with the severity of the disease (P = 0.2364). The study found a high recovery rate (101, 96.3%) with a mortality of 3 patients (2.8%) in severe cases. Elevated serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels (P = 0.0025), pleural effusion on chest X-ray (P = 0.000452), abdominal pain (P = 0.0041), and a positive tourniquet test (P < 0.0001) were found to be significantly associated with severe dengue. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were both found to be positive more frequently in severe cases compared to non-severe cases (P = 0.0361). Conclusions This study observed a high rate of recovery and low mortality, owing to the timely management. A possible shift in the seasonal distribution of dengue was observed, with many cases occurring in the winter season. While thrombocytopenia was prevalent, it was not found to be significantly associated with disease severity or bleeding. On the other hand, elevated liver enzymes, pleural effusion, abdominal pain, and a positive tourniquet test were found to be more strongly associated with severe dengue. They may serve as valuable early clinical indicators for the severity of the disease.",2025 Jun,"['background', 'dengue', 'arboviral infection', 'india', 'worldwide', 'dengue', 'clinical spectrum', 'age groups', 'changing', 'epidemiology', 'presentation', 'early diagnosis', 'management', 'prospective observational study', 'epidemiological profile', 'hospitalized dengue-positive', 'children', 'aged', 'years', 'correlate', 'clinical', 'hematological profiles', 'methodology', 'children', 'laboratory-confirmed', 'dengue', 'study', 'study', 'severe', 'non-severe', 'dengue', 'world health organization', 'classification', 'clinical examination', 'laboratory investigations', 'complete blood count', 'liver enzymes', 'coagulation profile', 'imaging', 'chest x-ray', 'abdominal ultrasound', 'data', 'analyzed', 'chi-square test', 'logistic regression analysis', 'cases', 'children', 'non-severe', 'dengue', 'severe', 'dengue', 'age', 'children', 'months', 'male', 'predominance', 'identified', 'symptoms', 'fever', 'vomiting', 'abdominal pain', 'thrombocytopenia', 'children', 'associated with', 'severity', 'disease', 'study', 'mortality', 'patients', 'severe', 'cases', 'elevated', 'serum', 'glutamate pyruvate transaminase', 'levels', 'pleural effusion', 'chest x-ray', 'abdominal pain', 'positive tourniquet test', 'associated with', 'severe', 'dengue', 'non-structural protein 1', 'immunoglobulin m', 'igm', 'antibodies', 'positive', 'severe', 'cases', 'non-severe', 'cases', 'study', 'rate', 'recovery', 'low', 'mortality', 'management', 'seasonal distribution', 'dengue', 'cases', 'winter', 'season', 'thrombocytopenia', 'associated with', 'disease severity', 'bleeding', 'elevated', 'liver enzymes', 'pleural effusion', 'abdominal pain', 'positive tourniquet test', 'associated with', 'severe', 'dengue', 'clinical indicators', 'severity', 'disease']",['India']
40739540,Study of rheumatoid arthritis in older patients: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in older adults is a chronic inflammatory condition causing severe disability and impacting patients' physical, psychological, and social health. It lowers productivity in society and puts pressure on healthcare systems. This study aims to explore the different aspects of RA and investigate the diagnostic potential of serum marker 14-3-3eta. METHOD: This Cross-sectional study recruited 205 arthritis patients (63 RA and 142 OA) over sixty years old. The participants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation according to the established design. Anti-CCP and serum 14-3-3eta levels were measured. Simple logistic regression was performed to identify significant predictors of RA. ROC curve determined optimal cut-off value for 14-3-3eta. RESULTS: This study reported an average age of 63.67 years with a high female-to-male ratio of 4:1 in the RA cohort, while in the OA cohort, the mean age was 65.5 years with a low female-to-male ratio of 2:1 overall. Symptomatically, RA patients exhibited earlier onset, pronounced early morning stiffness, fever, weight loss, myalgia, and fatigue, all with highly significant p-values (< 0.001). Comorbidities showed higher incidences of anemia, ILD, and osteoporosis in RA patients. Impaired ADL and IADL were noted in 17.5% and 73.2%, respectively. Impaired HMSE and GDS were found in 36.5% and 74.6%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis identified key predictors distinguishing RA from OA, including EMS (OR: 1.09, p < 0.001), fever (OR: 6.68, p < 0.001), weight loss (OR: 6.35, p < 0.001), myalgia (OR: 5.07, p < 0.001), osteoporosis (OR: 2.21, p = 0.013), ACCP levels (OR: 1.28, p < 0.001), and the novel marker 14-3-3eta (OR: 2.87, p = 0.047). Using both ACCP and14-3-3eta markers, 88.88% of RA patients were positive for at least one marker, enhancing its diagnostic coverage. Elderly onset RA (EORA) patients had a significantly higher age and shorter disease duration compared to those with young onset RA (YORA). The female-to-male ratio in the YORA and EORA group were 6.97:1 and 1.66:1 respectively. PMR-like symptoms were more prevalent in the EORA group (31.25% vs.14.9%). Hypothyroidism was more frequent in the EORA group (31% vs. 17%). Sulfasalazine was more commonly prescribed in both EORA (100%) and YORA (89%) groups. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to a better understanding of distinguishing RA from OA. It also highlights the differences between young and elderly onset RA, and supports the diagnostic potential of the serum marker 14-3-3eta.",2025 Jul 30,"['background', 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'older adults', 'chronic', 'severe', 'disability', ""patients'"", 'physical', 'psychological', 'social health', 'productivity', 'society', 'pressure', 'healthcare systems', 'study', 'investigate', 'diagnostic', 'potential', 'serum marker', 'cross-sectional study', 'arthritis', 'patients', 'years', 'participants', 'clinical evaluation', 'design', 'anti-ccp', 'serum', 'levels', 'measured', 'logistic regression', 'predictors', 'roc curve', 'optimal', 'cut-off value', 'study', 'average', 'age', 'years', 'female-to-male ratio', 'cohort', 'cohort', 'age', 'years', 'low', 'female-to-male ratio', 'overall', 'symptomatically', 'patients', 'stiffness', 'fever', 'weight loss', 'myalgia', 'fatigue', 'p-values', 'comorbidities', 'incidences', 'anemia', 'ild', 'osteoporosis', 'patients', 'impaired', 'adl', 'iadl', 'impaired', 'hmse', 'gds', 'logistic regression analysis', 'predictors', 'ems', 'fever', 'weight loss', 'myalgia', 'osteoporosis', 'accp', 'levels', 'novel', 'marker', 'accp', 'markers', 'patients', 'positive', 'marker', 'diagnostic coverage', 'elderly onset ra', 'eora', 'patients', 'significantly higher', 'age', 'shorter', 'compared', 'young onset ra', 'yora', 'female-to-male ratio', 'yora', 'eora', 'group', '1.66:1', 'pmr-like', 'symptoms', 'prevalent', 'eora', 'group', 'hypothyroidism', 'frequent', 'eora', 'group', 'sulfasalazine', 'prescribed', 'eora', 'yora', 'groups', 'study', 'young', 'elderly', 'diagnostic', 'potential', 'serum marker']",[]
40739406,Efficacy of probiotics in reducing the duration and severity of acute gastroenteritis in children: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVES: Acute gastroenteritis is a leading global health concern among children, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in treatment, effective management remains a challenge. Probiotics aim to restore gut homeostasis by correcting intestinal dysbiosis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the severity and duration of diarrhea in children with acute gastroenteritis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across four major databases using the keywords ""acute diarrhea,"" ""pediatric,"" and ""probiotics,"" among others. Only double-arm randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included, focusing on the efficacy of probiotics in treating pediatric acute diarrhea. Data analysis was performed using Stata 16.0, with a random-effects model applied to account for study variability. RESULTS: Out of 1470 studies screened, 25 RCTs involving 5170 patients (2552 in the probiotic group and 2618 in the placebo group) met the inclusion criteria. Probiotics significantly reduced the overall duration of diarrhea (mean difference [MD]: -7.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -14.60 to -0.91; p = 0.03). Diarrhea frequency was notably reduced on Day 2 (MD: -1.03; 95% CI: -2.06 to 0.00; p = 0.05) and Day 5 (MD: -0.51; 95% CI: -0.83 to -0.18; p = 0.002). Probiotics also significantly reduced the duration of vomiting (MD: -0.19; 95% CI: -0.28 to -0.09; p < 0.01), with a nonsignificant trend in fever reduction. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates the clinical efficacy of probiotics in reducing the duration of diarrhea and vomiting in children with acute gastroenteritis. Future trials are recommended to further explore the role of specific probiotic strains and combinations to enhance treatment outcomes.",2025 Jul 30,"['objectives', 'acute gastroenteritis', 'global health', 'children', 'morbidity', 'mortality', 'treatment', 'effective', 'management', 'probiotics', 'restore', 'gut homeostasis', 'intestinal', 'dysbiosis', 'systematic review', 'meta-analysis', 'efficacy', 'probiotics', 'reducing', 'severity', 'duration', 'children', 'acute gastroenteritis', 'comprehensive', 'literature', 'search', 'databases', 'keywords', 'pediatric', 'probiotics', 'randomized clinical trials', 'rcts', 'efficacy', 'probiotics', 'treating', 'pediatric', 'data analysis', 'stata', 'random-effects model', 'study', 'variability', 'studies', 'screened', 'rcts', 'patients', 'probiotic', 'group', 'placebo', 'group', 'inclusion criteria', 'probiotics', 'duration of diarrhea', 'mean difference', 'confidence interval', 'diarrhea', 'frequency', 'reduced', 'day 2', 'day 5', 'probiotics', 'reduced', 'duration of vomiting', 'fever', 'reduction', 'meta-analysis', 'clinical efficacy', 'probiotics', 'reducing', 'duration', 'vomiting', 'children', 'acute gastroenteritis', 'trials', 'probiotic', 'strains', 'combinations', 'treatment outcomes']",[]
40734786,"Clinical Profile, Intensive Care Needs, and Outcome of Children with Adenoviral Pneumonia: A Retrospective Study from a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India.","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Adenoviral pneumonia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among children. There is limited data about the clinical profile, intensive care needs, and outcomes of children with adenoviral pneumonia from resource-limited settings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the pediatric emergency room (PER) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care hospital in North India over a period of a period of 2 years (July 2022 to June 2024). The data collection included demographic and clinical features, laboratory investigations, complications, treatment, intensive care needs, and outcomes. RESULTS: Eighty-five children were enrolled, majority were <1 year of age and males (71.7% each). All presented with fever and respiratory symptoms. The common complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (47%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (26%), shock (25%), and encephalopathy (25%). PICU admission was needed in 46% of children. The intensive care needs included invasive mechanical ventilation (48%), CPAP (39%), HFNC (9%), vasoactive drugs (25%), IVIG (8%), RRT (6%), and cidofovir (5%). The duration of ER, PICU, and hospital stay was 48 (24-96) hours, 7 (4-14) days, and 9 (5-18) days, respectively. The mortality rate was 22%. On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of mortality were low admission pH, myocardial dysfunction, acute kidney (AKI), ARDS, shock, encephalopathy, MODS, and healthcare-associated infection (HCAI). CONCLUSION: Infants constituted the largest group of patients requiring admission for adenoviral infection to pediatric emergency in a tertiary care center. Common complications were ARDS, shock, MODS, and encephalopathy. Nearly half required PICU admission for organ support. The mortality rate was 22%; and low admission pH, myocardial dysfunction, AKI, ARDS, shock, encephalopathy, MODS, and HCAI were independent predictors of mortality.

40734658,Beyond serology: using molecular methods for the detection of Rickettsia and Orientia in clinical samples.,"BACKGROUND: Serological assays and conventional PCR used for detecting Rickettsia and Orientia are time-consuming. Given that therapeutic approaches for these infections overlap, early molecular detection significantly enhances timely clinical management. This study evaluates the utility of real-time PCR for the detection of Rickettsia and Orientia compared with ELISA and the Weil-Felix test. METHODS: A total of 243 patients (92 females and 151 males) were enrolled. The Weil-Felix test and ELISA were performed to detect the spotted fever group, the typhus group and Orientia. Molecular testing included Pan-Rickettsial PCR targeting Pan antigen and real-time PCR for Orientia targeting 47 kDa. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy were calculated. RESULTS: Real-time PCR exhibited a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 88.5-95.0%, 83.25-96.0%, 81.91-96.0%, 89.42-95.0% and 85.68-95.0%, respectively. The ELISA showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy of 81.05-96.0%, 89.45-95.0%, 88-95.0%, 83.18-96.0% and 85.68-95.8%, respectively.

40733721,Recovering Immunogenic Orthohantavirus puumalaense N Protein from Pellets of Recombinant Escherichia coli.,"(1) Background: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) remains a prevalent zoonosis in Eurasia. Orthohantavirus puumalaense (PUUV), carried by bank voles (Myodes glareolus), is the principal zoonotic pathogen of HFRS in this region. Despite ongoing efforts to develop effective drugs and vaccines against PUUV, this challenge remains. (2) Aim: In this study, we aimed to express a large quantity of the PUUV recombinant N (rN) protein using E. coli. We also sought to develop a protocol for extracting the rN protein from pellets, solubilizing, and refolding it to restore its native form. This protocol is crucial for producing a large quantity of rN protein to develop vaccines and diagnostic tools for HFRS. (3) Methods; PUUV S segment open reading frame (ORF) coding for N protein was synthesized and cloned into the plasmid vector pET-28 (A+). The ORF was transformed, expressed and induced in BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli strain. Subsequently, rN protein was purified using immobilized metal affinity and ion chromatography. Immune reactivity of rN protein was tested by employing in house and commercial VektoHanta-IgG kit ELISA methods (both in vitro and in vivo). (4) Results: The best conditions for scaling up the expression of the PUUV rN protein were an incubation temperature of 20  degrees C during a 20 h incubation period, followed by induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. The most significant protein yield was achieved when the pellets were incubated in denaturing buffer with 8M urea. The highest yield of refolded proteins was attained using non-denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl) supplemented with arginine. A final 50 muL of PUUV rN protein solution with a concentration of 7 mg/mL was recovered from 1 L of culture. The rN protein elicited an antibody response in vivo and reacted with serum taken from patients with HFRS by ELISA in vitro. (5) Conclusion: Therefore, the orthohantavirus N protein's ability to elicit immune response in vivo suggests that it can be used to develop vaccines against PUUV after conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to ascertain neutralising antibodies.",2025 Jul 10,"['hemorrhagic fever', 'renal syndrome', 'hfrs', 'zoonosis', 'eurasia', 'orthohantavirus puumalaense', 'puuv', 'bank voles', 'myodes glareolus', 'principal', 'zoonotic', 'pathogen', 'hfrs', 'region', 'effective', 'drugs', 'vaccines', 'puuv', 'study', 'quantity', 'puuv', 'recombinant n (rn) protein', 'e. coli', 'protocol', 'rn protein', 'pellets', 'solubilizing', 'refolding', 'native', 'protocol', 'quantity', 'rn protein', 'vaccines', 'diagnostic tools', 'hfrs', 'puuv', 's segment open reading frame', 'orf', 'n protein', 'synthesized', 'cloned', 'plasmid', 'pet-28', 'orf', 'expressed', 'induced', 'bl21(de3) plyss', 'e. coli', 'strain', 'rn protein', 'immobilized', 'metal', 'affinity', 'ion chromatography', 'immune reactivity', 'rn protein', 'house', 'vektohanta-igg kit elisa methods', 'in vitro', 'in vivo', 'scaling', 'expression', 'puuv', 'rn protein', 'incubation', 'temperature', 'incubation', 'period', 'induction', 'iptg', 'protein yield', 'pellets', 'incubated', 'denaturing buffer', 'urea', 'refolded proteins', 'non-denaturing buffer', 'arginine', 'puuv', 'rn protein solution', 'concentration', 'culture', 'rn protein', 'antibody response', 'in vivo', 'reacted', 'serum', 'patients', 'hfrs', 'elisa', 'in vitro', ""orthohantavirus n protein's"", 'immune response', 'in vivo', 'vaccines', 'puuv', 'in vitro', 'in vivo studies', 'neutralising antibodies']",['Cuba']

She exhibited multiple painful nodules scattered across her body for 2 months, initially small but progressively increasing in size. Initially diagnosed with Sweet syndrome, a skin biopsy revealed subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, confirmed through immunohistochemistry analysis. Treatment started with antibiotics and antipyretics. Upon ruling out septicaemia, steroid therapy was initiated, resulting in an immediate reduction in fever and rash. However, 2 months post-diagnosis, new lesions emerged, prompting a trial of dapsone, which led to their complete resolution without residual evidence. Subsequently, the case was transitioned to the obstetrician for safe management during parturition.

40727211,Enucleation with Fat Grafting for a True Large Median Palatine Cyst- a Case Report and a Review of Relevant Literature.,"BACKGROUND: Median palatine cysts are uncommon nonodontogenic lesions found in the midline of the hard palate with only 22 cases reported in literature hitherto. Often asymptomatic, they are frequently discovered incidentally during routine clinical examination. We report a case of large median palatine cyst with a novel technique to mitigate the risk of oronasal fistula and give a brief review on the current literature on the entity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old male presented with recurrent purulent nasal discharge, right-sided nasal obstruction, fever, and headaches persisting for six months. Clinical examination revealed a mucosa-covered bulge obstructing the right nasal cavity and partially affecting the left. Intraoral examination identified a soft, fluctuant midline palatal swelling communicating with the nasal cavity. Computed tomography revealed a well-circumscribed midline opacity involving the hard palate and nasal cavity. Surgical excision was performed using a U-shaped mucoperiosteal flap. Intraoperatively, a breach in the nasal mucosa was noted, necessitating reconstruction with a buccal fat pad to prevent oronasal fistula formation. RESULT: Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of median palatine cyst, characterised by a fibro-collagenous cyst wall lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited wound contracture with intact mucosa over the palate. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical management of median palatine cysts to prevent complications such as oronasal fistula. The described surgical approach effectively addressed the cyst while minimizing the risk of postoperative complications, highlighting its efficacy in managing this rare entity.

40727170,Inflammatory Pediatric Grisel Syndrome Secondary to Acute Adenoiditis: A Rare Case Report and Review of Literature.,"Grisel's syndrome is a rare condition characterized by non-traumatic atlantoaxial subluxation, typically secondary to inflammatory processes or surgical interventions in the head and neck region. The literature suggests a rare incidence of approximately 1:100,000,000 per year without gender predilection.The syndrome is often associated with an abnormal head posture and can lead to serious neurological complications if not diagnosed and treated promptly. This paper reviews the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and management strategies for Grisel's syndrome, emphasizing the importance of early recognition to prevent morbidity. A 7-year-old boy presented with torticollis, head tilt to the left, nasal obstruction, purulent nasal discharge, headache, and fever for 3 days. Examination showed painful head tilt to left, with neck rotation to the right and no neurological deficits. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed inflamed adenoid tissue with purulent discharge. CT scan showed a Fielding type I rotatory atlantoaxial subluxation. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics, analgesics, and a cervical collar. He became symptomatically better after 7 days of treatment and on follow-up, he had fully recovered and returned to normal activities. We performed a systematic review of the literature following the preferred reporting items for Systematic reviews. Literature searches were conducted in web-based search engines using MeSH terms and key words.

This study aimed to assess the clinical symptoms, gross pathology and histopathology, serum biochemical values, and molecular characterization of LSD in cattle. Cattle in Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Nilphamari, and Rangpur affected by LSD were initially diagnosed through clinical signs and gross lesions. Blood samples were then collected for biochemical analysis and molecular detection through PCR, and sequencing was performed to characterize the LSD virus (LSDV). The prevalence of LSD in northern areas of Bangladesh was 33.44%. The recorded clinical signs were high fever; firm, raised skin nodules around the head, neck, and limbs; swelling of the limbs and brisket area; and rough hair coat, nasal discharge, dyspnea, corneal opacity, and severe weakness. Grossly, a well-defined, hard swelling of around 1-3.00 cm in diameter in the skin accompanied enlargement of the nearby lymph nodes, and the nodules are composed of a hard, creamy-gray, or yellow clump of the tissue. Histopathologically, ballooning degeneration of the epidermal cell layers, intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies in distinct dermal and epidermal cells, necrosis with substantial infiltration of inflammatory cells, and congested blood vessels in the dermal layer were noted. While total protein, BUN, serum AST, and ALT were increased significantly (p < 0.05), the serum creatinine, GGT, and total albumin were not changed significantly compared with the healthy cattle. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the circulating isolates from northern part of Bangladesh were found in the same clades with India, Pakistan, and Thailand.

40717684,Detecting early markers of sepsis in paediatric patient with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time.,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated host response to infections, poses a critical threat. Cardiac surgery itself induces a robust inflammatory response, further exacerbated by cardiopulmonary bypass, causing notable clinical and physiological changes. Identifying sepsis early in the post-operative period with elevated septic markers becomes challenging, with delayed antibiotic intervention ultimately posing a fatal risk for the patient. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cross-sectional study aimed at identifying sepsis markers that include total leucocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, serum albumin, chest X-ray, blood, urine, and tracheal cultures, procalcitonin, c-reactive protein, serum lactate >2.5 mmol/l along with clinical parameters (fever, hypotension, tachycardia) on post-operative days 1, 3, 5, and 10 in paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time >100 min. RESULTS: Total leucocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, and platelet counts were not significant enough to detect early sepsis, especially in patients with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time. Chest X-ray was significant from post-operative day 3 onwards. Procalcitonin was significant from day 5, and C-reactive protein was significant only from day 10. Among the clinical parameters, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels were significant from post-operative day 1 in the patients developing sepsis. CONCLUSION: Neonates and infants faced a higher sepsis risk than older children. Longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic clamp times correlated with increased sepsis likelihood. Clinical factors outweighed laboratory indicators for early sepsis detection post-cardiac surgery, prompting prompt investigation and intervention.",2025 Jul 28,"['background', 'sepsis', 'life-threatening', 'organ dysfunction', 'dysregulated', 'host', 'infections', 'cardiac surgery', 'induces', 'inflammatory response', 'exacerbated', 'cardiopulmonary bypass', 'clinical', 'physiological', 'sepsis', 'early', 'post-operative', 'period', 'elevated', 'septic markers', 'delayed', 'antibiotic', 'intervention', 'fatal', 'risk', 'patient', 'cross-sectional study', 'sepsis', 'markers', 'absolute', 'neutrophil', 'platelet count', 'serum albumin', 'chest x-ray', 'blood', 'urine', 'tracheal cultures', 'procalcitonin', 'c-reactive protein', 'serum lactate', 'clinical', 'parameters', 'fever', 'hypotension', 'tachycardia', 'post-operative', 'days', 'paediatric patients', 'cardiac surgery', 'prolonged', 'cardiopulmonary bypass time', 'total leucocyte count', 'absolute', 'neutrophil', 'platelet counts', 'detect', 'sepsis', 'patients', 'prolonged', 'cardiopulmonary bypass time', 'chest x-ray', 'post-operative', 'day', 'onwards', 'procalcitonin', 'day', 'c-reactive protein', 'day', 'clinical', 'parameters', 'fever', 'hypotension', 'tachycardia', 'elevated', 'post-operative', 'day', 'patients', 'sepsis', 'neonates', 'infants', 'sepsis', 'risk', 'older children', 'cardiopulmonary bypass', 'aortic clamp times', 'correlated', 'increased', 'sepsis', 'likelihood', 'clinical factors', 'laboratory indicators', 'sepsis', 'detection', 'post-cardiac surgery', 'investigation', 'intervention']",[]

40715741,New insights on pharmacological potential of montelukast: a comprehensive review.,"Leukotrienes are strong lipid mediators that mainly act through particular leukotriene receptors to produce a broad range of clinical effects. These receptors facilitate the complex biochemical and physiological responses associated with leukotrienes. An examination of their roles in various diseases reveals the pharmacological effects of anti-leukotriene agents, specifically their ability to modulate inflammatory responses within the body. Recent research has focused on the dual nature of these lipids, revealing that they may trigger a mild inflammatory response, which is a key significant factor in neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndromes, renal difficulties, liver damage, and cancer. Among the available modulators, Montelukast is distinguished as a particularly effective orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist. In the United States and around the world, it has been available and generally approved for the treatment of hay fever and asthma for more than 11 years. It is frequently recommended as an adjuvant to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids for patients who need additional medication, or as an alternative first-line treatment for pediatric asthma, even in cases with mild, persistent symptoms. Apart from anti-asthmatic and anti-allergic activities, Montelukast has numerous pharmacological activities such as anticancer, neuroprotective, anti-osteoporotic, renal protective, liver protective, cardioprotective, anti-arthritic effects, and other beneficial effects on the body. Montelukast operates through a highly effective mechanism that makes it a potent ally in the battle against various respiratory conditions, including asthma and hay fever.",2025 Jul 26,"['leukotrienes', 'lipid mediators', 'leukotriene receptors', 'clinical effects', 'receptors', 'complex', 'biochemical', 'physiological responses', 'associated with', 'leukotrienes', 'examination', 'diseases', 'pharmacological', 'anti-leukotriene agents', 'modulate', 'inflammatory responses', 'body', 'research', 'nature', 'lipids', 'mild', 'inflammatory response', 'neurological diseases', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'metabolic syndromes', 'renal difficulties', 'liver damage', 'cancer', 'modulators', 'montelukast', 'effective', 'orally', 'leukotriene receptor antagonist', 'united states', 'world', 'treatment', 'hay fever', 'asthma', 'years', 'adjuvant', 'low-dose', 'inhaled corticosteroids', 'patients', 'medication', 'alternative', 'first-line treatment', 'pediatric asthma', 'cases', 'mild', 'persistent', 'symptoms', 'anti-asthmatic', 'anti-allergic activities', 'montelukast', 'pharmacological activities', 'anticancer', 'neuroprotective', 'anti-osteoporotic', 'renal', 'liver', 'cardioprotective', 'anti-arthritic effects', 'effects', 'body', 'montelukast', 'operates', 'effective', 'mechanism', 'battle', 'respiratory conditions', 'asthma', 'hay fever']",['United States']
40715601,"Identification of potential VP40 inhibitor of Marburg virus through molecular docking, pharmacokinetic analysis and molecular dynamics simulation.","West Africa has been experiencing a resurgence of Marburg virus disease (MVD), a zoonotic pathogen that causes severe hemorrhagic fever in both humans and primates. Regretfully, there are not any effective medications on the market right now. The binding interactions between MARV VP40, a protein essential to viral replication, and a commercial medication, estradiol benzoate, and a natural substance, procyanidin, were examined in this work. Ten hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with important residues (Ala316, Val317, Lys230, Glu89, Asn87) stabilized procyanidin's superior binding affinity (- 11.3 kcal/mol) over estradiol benzoate (- 8.9 kcal/mol), according to molecular docking. With a lower radius of gyration (1.94 nm) and RMSD (0.28 nm) than estradiol benzoate (RMSD: 0.37 nm, Rg: 1.97 nm), procyanidin formed a more stable complex, according to molecular dynamics simulations conducted over 200 ns. Additionally, procyanidin showed decreased solvent accessibility and increased intermolecular hydrogen bonding (average 3.50 bonds), suggesting stronger binding. Procyanidin's superior drug-likeness, decreased cardiotoxicity, and decreased carcinogenicity potential were all shown by ADMET analysis. Its higher binding energy (- 57.82 KJ/mol) was further validated by free energy calculations (MM-PBSA). According to these results, procyanidin, a natural substance shows promise as an antiviral medication against MARV targeting its VP40 protein.",2025 Jul 25,"['west africa', 'resurgence', 'marburg virus disease', 'mvd', 'zoonotic', 'pathogen', 'severe', 'hemorrhagic fever', 'humans', 'primates', 'effective', 'medications', 'market', 'binding interactions', 'marv', 'vp40', 'protein', 'essential', 'viral replication', 'commercial medication', 'estradiol benzoate', 'natural substance', 'procyanidin', 'hydrogen bonds', 'hydrophobic', 'interactions', 'residues', 'ala316', 'val317', 'lys230', 'glu89', 'asn87', 'stabilized', ""procyanidin's"", 'superior', 'estradiol benzoate', 'molecular docking', 'lower radius of gyration', 'rmsd', 'estradiol benzoate', 'rmsd', 'procyanidin', 'complex', 'molecular dynamics simulations', 'procyanidin', 'decreased', 'solvent', 'accessibility', 'increased', 'intermolecular hydrogen bonding', 'bonds', 'stronger', 'binding', ""procyanidin's"", 'superior', 'drug-likeness', 'decreased', 'cardiotoxicity', 'decreased', 'carcinogenicity', 'potential', 'admet analysis', 'binding energy', 'free energy calculations', 'mm-pbsa', 'results', 'procyanidin', 'natural substance', 'antiviral medication', 'marv', 'targeting', 'vp40 protein']",[]
40715493,Evaluation of APACHE II score as predictor of outcome in patients with ruptured liver abscess: prospective study in a tertiary care hospital.,"Ruptured liver abscess is a critical condition with high morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with systemic comorbidities. This 18-month observational cohort study at Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, evaluated the prognostic value of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score in predicting outcomes for patients with radiologically confirmed ruptured liver abscesses. A total of 69 patients (88.4% male, mean age 44 years) were included. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (100%) and fever (76.8%). Treatment modalities included percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) in 46.4% of patients, open surgical drainage in 34.8%, and conservative management in the remainder. Patients undergoing surgical drainage had significantly higher APACHE II scores (mean 9 +/- 4) than those treated with PCD (mean 7 +/- 3; p = 0.041). The overall mortality rate was 21%, with mortality significantly higher in the surgical group (45.8%) compared to the PCD group (3.1%; p = 0.000). An APACHE II score > 9 was strongly associated with increased mortality and the need for surgery (p = 0.010). Colonic involvement was seen in 41.6% of surgical cases, with 10 cases presenting with colonic perforation. Higher APACHE II scores correlated with longer hospital stays and more severe complications. The study concludes that the APACHE II score is an effective prognostic tool for assessing disease severity and guiding treatment in ruptured liver abscess cases. PCD is favoured for stable patients, while surgical intervention is necessary for those with high APACHE II scores, failed drainage, or colonic involvement, emphasizing the importance of early risk stratification. This study has its limitations of being single centric with a sample size of 69 patients.",2025 Jul 26,"['ruptured', 'liver abscess', 'morbidity', 'mortality', 'patients', 'systemic', 'comorbidities', 'observational', 'cohort study', 'safdarjung hospital', 'new delhi', 'evaluated', 'prognostic value', 'acute physiology and', 'chronic health evaluation ii (', 'score', 'predicting', 'outcomes', 'patients', 'radiologically', 'ruptured', 'liver abscesses', 'patients', 'male', 'age', 'years', 'presenting symptoms', 'abdominal pain', 'fever', 'treatment modalities', 'percutaneous catheter drainage', 'pcd', 'patients', 'open surgical drainage', 'conservative management', 'patients', 'surgical drainage', 'apache ii scores', 'treated with', 'pcd', 'mortality rate', 'mortality', 'significantly higher', 'surgical group', 'pcd', 'group', 'apache ii score', 'associated with', 'increased', 'mortality', 'surgery', 'colonic', 'involvement', 'surgical cases', 'cases', 'colonic perforation', 'apache ii scores', 'correlated', 'longer', 'hospital stays', 'severe', 'complications', 'study', 'apache ii score', 'effective', 'prognostic tool', 'disease severity', 'treatment', 'ruptured', 'liver abscess', 'cases', 'pcd', 'stable', 'patients', 'surgical intervention', 'apache ii scores', 'failed', 'drainage', 'colonic', 'involvement', 'early', 'risk', 'stratification', 'study', 'limitations', 'sample size', 'patients']",[]
40715163,Clinical and molecular epidemiology of chikungunya outbreaks during 2019-2022 in India.,"Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) is endemic in India, with multiple outbreaks occurring across the country since its reemergence in 2005. Suspected CHIKF patients were recruited from four clinical sites during 2019-2022, with data collected on sociodemographic, clinical, and epidemiological aspects. Sera samples were screened for IgM, IgG antibodies and viral RNA along with their neutralizing capacity. Envelope genes of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) isolated were sequenced and further analysed. A total of 1312 suspected patients were screened during the study period; 258 patients were laboratory-confirmed with CHIKV infection. Severe clinical manifestation was observed in the patients during the viremic phase of infection. The neutralization potential was found to be increasing proportionally with the onset of illness, coinciding with the rise of IgG antibodies. Three of the four clinical sites had reported CHIKF outbreaks at different time points during the study period, and a distinct pattern of clinical presentation was observed across the sites. Phylogenetic and network analyses of E1, E2 and E3 genes from 62 CHIKV isolates demonstrated their evolution within the country.

40707092,Clinical spectrum of tuberculosis in adolescents (10-19 years) in a tertiary care center of North India.,"BACKGROUND\OBJECTIVES: There is limited literature available to characterize tuberculosis (TB) in adolescents despite them sharing a high burden of the disease. Ours is the first prospective study in India and worldwide to study the clinical profile of tuberculosis in adolescents aged 10-19 years. METHODS: We enrolled 82 children and adolescents between March 2021 to March 2022. The diagnosis of TB was made on the basis of National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) guidelines 2020. Adolescents were divided into 3 age groups: early (10-13 years), middle (14-17 years), and late adolescents (18-19 years)and the results were compared among the three groups. A two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The middle age adolescents comprised majority of our study population and females were more than males. The common presenting features were fever, chest pain, breathing difficulty with majority belonging to lower socioeconomic status. The pulmonary TB accounted for 56% and extrapulmonary constituted 44% of the cases. The notable extrapulmonary cases were disseminated TB with secondary lymphangiectasia, compressive myelopathy, sacroiliac joint arthropathy among others. Infiltrates/consolidation were the most frequent radiological findings in patients with pulmonary TB. The microbiological confirmation was available in 44% of the cases. The microbiological positivity was higher in histopathological specimens and in late adolescents. Two patients were rifampicin resistant. CONCLUSION: There was a varied clinical presentation of TB in this population. The extrapulmonary cases as well as the microbiological yield increased with increasing age of the cases.",2025 Jul,"['background\\objectives', 'literature', 'tuberculosis', 'adolescents', 'burden', 'disease', 'ours', 'prospective study', 'india', 'study', 'clinical profile', 'tuberculosis', 'adolescents', 'aged', 'years', 'children', 'adolescents', 'diagnosis', 'national tuberculosis elimination program', 'ntep', 'guidelines', 'adolescents', 'age groups', 'early', 'years', 'middle', 'years', 'late adolescents', 'results', 'groups', 'two-sided p value', 'statistically significant', 'middle age', 'adolescents', 'study population', 'females', 'males', 'features', 'fever', 'chest pain', 'breathing difficulty', 'lower', 'socioeconomic status', 'pulmonary tb', 'extrapulmonary', 'cases', 'extrapulmonary', 'cases', 'disseminated', 'secondary lymphangiectasia', 'compressive myelopathy', 'sacroiliac joint arthropathy', 'infiltrates/consolidation', 'frequent', 'radiological findings', 'patients', 'pulmonary tb', 'microbiological', 'confirmation', 'cases', 'microbiological positivity', 'histopathological', 'specimens', 'adolescents', 'patients', 'rifampicin', 'resistant', 'clinical presentation', 'population', 'extrapulmonary', 'cases', 'microbiological', 'increased', 'increasing', 'age', 'cases']",['India']

40704221,Intersectoral collaboration in zoonotic disease surveillance and response: A One Health study in the Greater Accra metropolitan area of Ghana.,"The One Health (OH) approach is essential for preventing and managing zoonotic diseases through the promotion of intersectoral collaboration. Integrated surveillance systems enhance resource efficiency, support targeted interventions, and provide a comprehensive understanding of disease dynamics. However, operationalizing OH in resource-limited contexts encounters various obstacles due to systemic limitations. This study explores intersectoral collaboration across sectors engaged in zoonotic disease surveillance and response (ZDSR) in Ghana at the district level, identifying key operational gaps. We performed 46 key informant interviews with actors in the human, animal and wildlife health sectors directly involved in ZDSR. We developed an interview guide informed by WHO's Components of Surveillance and Response Systems for Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and the Evaluation of collaboration in a multisectoral surveillance system (ECoSur) tool. The responses were analyzed using a content analysis approach. The results showed that for district-level surveillance activities, relationships between the human and animal health sectors existed in 87.5 % of districts, albeit weak, while the wildlife sector was absent. Rabies/dog bites, Avian Influenza, Lassa fever and COVID-19 were the primary triggers of intersectoral collaboration. Anthrax, zoonotic tuberculosis and trypanosomiasis saw minimal intersectoral collaboration. Collaborative activities were mostly addressed through reactive and event-driven approaches focusing on case-specific data sharing, alerts in outbreak events, and committee participation. However, core surveillance functions like disease detection, data analysis, and data management practices were performed in siloes. These results highlight the need for adaptable, proactive, and systemic frameworks that enhance intersectoral collaboration for the surveillance of neglected zoonotic diseases in Ghana.",2025 Dec,"['preventing', 'zoonotic diseases', 'promotion', 'intersectoral collaboration', 'integrated surveillance systems', 'resource', 'efficiency', 'targeted', 'interventions', 'comprehensive', 'disease dynamics', 'resource-limited', 'contexts', 'encounters', 'obstacles', 'systemic', 'limitations', 'study', 'intersectoral collaboration', 'sectors', 'zoonotic disease', 'surveillance', 'response', 'zdsr', 'ghana', 'district', 'level', 'operational', 'informant interviews', 'actors', 'human', 'animal', 'wildlife', 'health sectors', 'zdsr', 'interview', ""who's"", 'components', 'surveillance', 'monitoring', 'evaluation framework', 'evaluation', 'collaboration', 'multisectoral surveillance system', 'responses', 'analyzed', 'content analysis', 'results', 'district-level surveillance activities', 'relationships', 'human', 'animal', 'health sectors', 'districts', 'weak', 'wildlife sector', 'absent', 'rabies/dog bites', 'avian', 'lassa fever', 'covid-19', 'primary triggers', 'intersectoral collaboration', 'anthrax', 'zoonotic tuberculosis', 'trypanosomiasis', 'intersectoral collaboration', 'collaborative activities', 'reactive', 'event-driven', 'case-specific', 'alerts', 'outbreak', 'events', 'committee', 'participation', 'core surveillance functions', 'disease detection', 'data analysis', 'data management practices', 'siloes', 'results', 'proactive', 'systemic frameworks', 'intersectoral collaboration', 'surveillance', 'zoonotic diseases', 'ghana']",['Ghana']
40703960,Dengue in older inpatients in the post-COVID-19 Period: a case series from a North Indian tertiary center.,"Studies on dengue in older patients are scarce from India. The patterns of dengue in the post-COVID-19 period have been poorly studied globally. Our case series describes the patterns and outcomes of dengue in inpatients of the geriatric unit of a tertiary university hospital in North India during the period of August -December 2023. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with dengue out of 182 admissions during the study period (13.2 %). The median (Q1-Q3) age of patients was 67.5 (64.75-75) years. Fever was present in all except one patient (95.8 %). Weakness, vomiting, dyspnea, and altered sensorium occurred in 41.7 %, 37.5 %, 29.2 %, and 20.8 %, respectively. Hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were observed in 58.3 %, 45.8 %, and 25 % of cases, and nearly one-third developed hepatitis. Leucopenia rates were relatively low. Dengue was severe in two-thirds, and acute kidney injury was the commonest complication. Three fatalities were observed. In summary, many older patients had atypical presentations of dengue, and the disease was severe in a significant proportion.

Acute complications that are uncommomly described postperforation of appendix may be salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, and pyosalpinx. A pyosalpinx or tubal abscess is the acute inflammation of the fallopian tube that fills up and swells with pus, which commonly results from inadequate or delayed treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Pyosalpinx may present with common symptoms such as lower abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, per vaginal discharge, and lesser noted symptoms such as fever and chills or remain silent. Primay pyosalpinx might occur as a severe sequelae of PID that is characterized by the inflammation of upper genital tract incorporating endometritis, salpingitis, and pelvic peritonitis.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence and patterns of self-medication practices in India. PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Embase were searched for studies reporting on the prevalence of self-medication in India and published between 2000 and October 2023. R software was used for analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted on moderators including geographical region, study population, sample size, and publication year. Heterogeneity was assessed using I(2) statistic. Qualitative synthesis analyzed reasons, conditions, information sources, and drug categories associated with self-medication. Sixty-six studies involving 29,873 participants were included. Pooled prevalence of self-medication in India was 64.4%. While the northern region of India had the highest rate at 81.9%, no significant difference was observed among other regions. Self-medication practices among students from the non-healthcare domain exhibited highest rate (86.1%), followed by students from healthcare domain (79.0%) and general population (59.7%). Studies with smaller sample sizes showed a higher prevalence (71.6%) of self-medication than those with larger sample sizes (55.8%). Major reasons for self-medication included perceptions of minor illness, time constraints, and financial restrictions. Common indications for which self-medication was done included fever, headache, and cough/cold. Pharmacists, past prescriptions, and advice from friends/family were leading sources of information.

We describe a 43-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, and rheumatic heart disease who was admitted with prolonged fever and dyspnea and found to have infective endocarditis. The patient developed persistent milky urine during hospitalization that was unresponsive to a high-protein, low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides. Filariasis serology was negative. Although his comorbidities are not primary etiologic factors for chyluria, the systemic inflammation and lymphatic congestion associated with endocarditis likely triggered central lymphatic obstruction, the reflux of chyle into the renal lymphatics, and chyluria. Diagnostic intranodal lymphangiography with Lipiodol delineated multiple left-sided pyelolymphatic fistulae. No additional embolic agent was administered; nonetheless, Lipiodol's inherent inflammatory and embolic effects led to the complete resolution of chyluria within 24 hours. This case underscores the value of thorough etio-pathological assessment in nonparasitic chyluria, highlights structural lymphatic abnormalities as pivotal contributors to disease persistence, and demonstrates the evolving dual diagnostic-therapeutic role of intranodal lymphangiography. We further review current imaging algorithms and minimally invasive endolymphatic interventions that can obviate surgical treatment in refractory chyluria.",2025 Jun,"['chyluria', 'passage', 'chyle-laden lymph', 'urine', 'filarial infection', 'diverse', 'nonparasitic settings', 'man', 'diabetes', 'hypertension', 'rheumatic heart disease', 'admitted with', 'prolonged', 'fever', 'dyspnea', 'infective endocarditis', 'patient', 'persistent', 'milky', 'urine', 'hospitalization', 'high-protein', 'low-fat diet', 'medium-chain triglycerides', 'filariasis', 'serology', 'negative', 'comorbidities', 'etiologic factors', 'chyluria', 'systemic inflammation', 'lymphatic congestion', 'associated with', 'endocarditis', 'reflux', 'chyle', 'renal lymphatics', 'chyluria', 'diagnostic intranodal lymphangiography', 'lipiodol', 'left-sided', 'pyelolymphatic fistulae', 'embolic agent', 'administered', ""lipiodol's"", 'inflammatory', 'embolic', 'effects', 'complete', 'resolution', 'chyluria', 'etio-pathological assessment', 'nonparasitic chyluria', 'structural lymphatic abnormalities', 'disease', 'persistence', 'intranodal lymphangiography', 'review current imaging', 'algorithms', 'minimally invasive', 'surgical treatment', 'refractory chyluria']",['Mali']

40692505,Burden of Chikungunya Fever and Its Economic and Social Impacts Worldwide: A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the social and economic impacts and disease burden of Chikungunya Fever globally through a systematic literature review. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search through MEDLINE (via PubMed), LILACS, and Embase databases, and grey literature, including studies of populations diagnosed with Chikungunya Fever or at risk of infection published in English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese, without date restrictions. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. Methodological quality was assessed using different tools. RESULTS: Forty-three publications were included. Until 2013, publications originated solely from the Asian and African continents. From 2015 onwards, South America emerged as the predominant source. Publications were classified as cost studies (25), including cost-of-illness (18) and program cost (6); burden of disease studies (10); cost-outcome studies (4), including cost-effectiveness (3) and cost-utility (1); and quality-of-life studies (15). Reported total direct costs associated with Chikungunya Fever ranged from US$ 3.5 million (US Virgin Islands, 2014-2015) to US$ 83.6 billion (Region of the Americas, 2013-2015). Direct medical costs varied from US$ 308.94 (Tamil Nadu, India, 2006) to US$ 33.7 million (Reunion Island, 2005-2006). Vector control program costs ranged from US$ 888,000 annually (Greece, 2013-2017) to US$ 466 million (Brazil, 2016). Estimated disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 population ranged from 4.53 (India, 2006) to 2432 (Region of the Americas, 2013-2015). Quality-of-life studies demonstrated substantial declines across multiple domains, indicating significant functional impairment due to Chikungunya Fever. CONCLUSION: Chikungunya Fever imposes a considerable economic and social burden, surpassing that of other endemic arboviral diseases such as dengue and yellow fever. These findings underscore the need for further research to accurately quantify the full scope of Chikungunya Fever-related costs and impacts on affected populations.",2025 Jul 22,"['objectives', 'study', 'investigate', 'social', 'economic impacts', 'disease', 'burden', 'chikungunya', 'fever', 'systematic literature review', 'comprehensive', 'literature', 'medline', 'pubmed', 'lilacs', 'embase databases', 'grey literature', 'studies', 'populations', 'diagnosed', 'chikungunya', 'risk', 'infection', 'published', 'english', 'spanish', 'french', 'portuguese', 'restrictions', 'reviewers', 'study selection', 'data extraction', 'quality assessment', 'methodological quality', 'assessed', 'tools', 'publications', 'publications', 'asian', 'african continents', 'south america', 'predominant', 'source', 'publications', 'cost studies', 'cost-of-illness', 'program', 'cost', 'burden', 'disease studies', 'cost-outcome studies', 'cost-effectiveness', 'cost-utility', 'quality-of-life studies', 'associated with', 'chikungunya', 'fever', 'americas', 'medical costs', 'tamil nadu', 'india', 'reunion island', 'vector control program', 'costs', 'annually', 'greece', 'brazil', 'estimated disability-adjusted life years', 'population', 'india', 'americas', 'quality-of-life', 'studies', 'multiple', 'domains', 'functional impairment', 'chikungunya', 'fever', 'chikungunya', 'fever', 'economic', 'social burden', 'endemic', 'arboviral diseases', 'dengue', 'yellow fever', 'findings', 'research', 'quantify', 'chikungunya', 'fever-related', 'costs', 'impacts', 'affected', 'populations']","['Brazil', 'Greece', 'India']"
40688822,Microbial Spectrum of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome With Special Reference to Non-Japanese Encephalitis Cases.,"BACKGROUND: Northeast India is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE), which causes acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Though there is no specific therapy for JE, many etiological agents of AES are treatable. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the AES cases for their etiologies, laboratory parameters, and associated clinical manifestations. METHODS: A hospital-based prospective observational study was carried out, enrolling all consecutive cases of AES satisfying the World Health Organization (WHO) definition. Blood was tested for the malaria parasite. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were processed by Gram staining, India ink staining for Cryptococcus, Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and culture for other bacteria and fungi. Serum and CSF samples lacking the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) IgM were processed for the detection of other etiologies. The CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect Enterovirus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and herpes simplex virus, and serum IgM enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) detected scrub typhus, Leptospira, dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile antibodies. RESULTS: Out of 395 AES cases tested, 77 were found to be positive for non-JE etiologies. Of these, dengue virus (n=32/371; 8.6%) was the most common, followed by scrub typhus (n=16/348; 4.6%) and Leptospira (n=10/362; 2.8%). Positive cases showed CSF pleocytosis (>5 WBC/cumm) and significantly higher protein level (n=6/11; 55%) and sugar level (n=8/11; 73%) in Streptococcus pneumoniae. All cases presented with fever (n=11/11; 100%), followed by altered mental status (n=18/19; 94.7%) and seizure (n=22/32; 68.7%). CONCLUSION: The number of non-JE causes of AES in Assam is higher. Scrub typhus, dengue virus, and Leptospira are other major infectious etiologies of AES that are treatable. Timely diagnosis of such cases will help reduce AES-related complications and mortality.",2025 Jun,"['background', 'northeast india', 'endemic', 'japanese', 'encephalitis', 'acute encephalitis syndrome', 'aes', 'therapy', 'etiological agents', 'aes', 'treatable', 'study', 'evaluate', 'aes', 'cases', 'etiologies', 'laboratory parameters', 'clinical', 'hospital-based', 'enrolling', 'consecutive', 'cases', 'aes', 'world health organization', 'who', 'definition', 'blood', 'malaria', 'parasite', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'csf', 'samples', 'gram staining', 'india ink staining', 'cryptococcus', 'ziehl-neelsen staining', 'acid-fast bacilli', 'afb', 'culture', 'bacteria', 'fungi', 'serum', 'csf', 'samples', 'japanese encephalitis virus', 'jev', 'igm', 'detection', 'etiologies', 'csf', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'pcr', 'detect', 'enterovirus', 'haemophilus influenzae', 'neisseria meningitidis', 'herpes simplex virus', 'serum igm enzyme-linked immunoassay', 'elisa', 'detected', 'scrub typhus', 'leptospira', 'dengue', 'chikungunya', 'west nile antibodies', 'aes', 'cases', 'positive', 'non-je etiologies', 'dengue virus', 'n=32/371', 'scrub typhus', 'n=16/348', 'leptospira', 'n=10/362', 'positive', 'cases', 'csf', 'pleocytosis', 'wbc/cumm', 'significantly higher', 'protein level', 'n=6/11', 'sugar', 'level', 'streptococcus pneumoniae', 'cases', 'fever', 'n=11/11', 'mental status', 'seizure', 'non-je', 'aes', 'assam', 'higher', 'scrub typhus', 'dengue virus', 'leptospira', 'infectious etiologies', 'aes', 'treatable', 'timely', 'diagnosis', 'cases', 'aes-related', 'complications', 'mortality']","['India', 'Japan']"
40688420,H1N1-associated acute leukoencephalopathy: An unusual presentation in a young adult indian male.,"The H1N1 virus commonly causes symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, which have a self-limited course in most cases. Neurological complications are rare, especially in adults. This case illustrates H1N1-associated acute leukoencephalopathy in a young adult with a favorable outcome and no lasting neurological deficits. The initial presentation included fever, sore throat, and myalgia, evolving into neurological symptoms, including dysarthria, nystagmus, and left-sided motor weakness. Comprehensive laboratory tests ruled out common bacterial, viral, or autoimmune causes, while MRI findings suggested acute leukoencephalopathy of infectious or toxic etiology. Although the urine toxicology screen showed traces of phenol, clinical evidence did not correlate with toxic exposure and pointed towards an infectious origin. A throat swab for Influenza/H1N1 PCR confirmed the diagnosis.

40685242,Neonatal complications and referral practices at birth: insights from a population-based study in the Indian state of Bihar.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore neonatal survival by type of neonatal complications at birth and referral pattern for these complications by place of delivery. SETTING: Bihar, India. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 15-49 years who had given live birth between July 2020 and June 2021. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MEASURES: Prevalence of neonatal complications at birth, referral pattern by complication and neonatal deaths by type of complication. RESULTS: Data were available for 6767 (81.8%) newborns including 717 neonatal deaths. The prevalence of at least one neonatal complication at birth was reported for 32.9% (95% CI 32.4 to 33.4) newborns, with the most common complications including difficulty in breathing (21.9%), high fever (20.7%), low birth weight (12.5%) and jaundice (13.2%). A total of 578 (26.6%; 95% CI 25.8 to 27.4) neonates with complications at birth were referred to another health provider, predominantly to private sector (68.1%, 93% and 78.7% from public facility, private facility and home). The complications with high referrals included meconium aspiration syndrome (64.1%; 95% CI: 61.1 to 67.1), inability to pass urine (54.7%; 95% CI: 42.1 to 67.2), difficulty in suckling (49.7%; 95% CI: 46.9 to 52.5), cold to touch (48.5%; 95% CI: 43.5 to 53.6), inability to cry (47.2%; 95% CI: 44.2 to 50.1), pneumonia (45.6%; 95% CI: 42.0 to 49.1), difficulty in breathing (44.0%; 95% CI: 42.5 to 45.6) and lethargy (43.5%; 95% CI: 38.4 to 48.6). Referrals were linked to higher neonatal deaths, in particular, among neonates born at home and referred for complications (84.7%; p<0.001) compared with those born in public facilities (59.8%) or private facilities (47.3%) and referred for complications.

40684877,Peptide-driven lateral flow platform for detection of classical swine fever viral antigen.,"Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is a highly contagious viral disease that causes substantial economic losses in the swine industry. Timely detection of CSFV infection is essential for effective disease control; however, current antibody-based diagnostic methods are limited due to the delayed host immune response. In this study, we developed a novel peptide-based lateral flow assay (LFA) targeting the E2 antigen of the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) to enable rapid and field-deployable detection. A synthetic peptide derived from the immunodominant region of the CSFV E2 protein was identified through bioinformatics analysis, synthesized, and conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) to enhance its immunogenicity. Polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits, purified, and validated via ELISA to confirm specificity to CSFV, showing no cross-reactivity with other swine viruses such as ASFV, PRRSV, PCV2, and PPV. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized using Mangifera indica leaf extract and characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). These nanoparticles were then conjugated to the purified anti-E2 antibodies and incorporated into LFA strips. The resulting assay exhibited high sensitivity, capable of detecting CSFV antigen concentrations as low as 20 ng/ml, with excellent specificity and no cross-reactivity. This peptide-based LFA provides a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective diagnostic tool for on-site CSF surveillance and outbreak management.",2025 Jul 18,"['classical', 'swine fever', 'csf', 'contagious', 'viral disease', 'economic losses', 'swine industry', 'timely', 'detection', 'csfv', 'infection', 'effective', 'disease control', 'antibody-based diagnostic methods', 'delayed', 'host', 'immune response', 'study', 'peptide-based lateral flow assay', 'lfa', 'targeting', 'e2 antigen', 'classical swine fever virus', 'csfv', 'rapid', 'field-deployable detection', 'synthetic peptide', 'immunodominant region', 'csfv', 'e2 protein', 'identified', 'bioinformatics analysis', 'synthesized', 'conjugated', 'keyhole limpet hemocyanin', 'klh', 'immunogenicity', 'polyclonal antibodies', 'rabbits', 'purified', 'elisa', 'specificity', 'csfv', 'cross-reactivity', 'swine viruses', 'asfv', 'prrsv', 'pcv2', 'ppv', 'silver', 'nanoparticles', 'agnps', 'biosynthesized', 'mangifera indica', 'leaf', 'extract', 'characterized', 'uv-vis spectroscopy', 'ftir', 'dynamic light scattering', 'dls', 'nanoparticles', 'conjugated', 'purified', 'anti-e2 antibodies', 'lfa', 'strips', 'assay', 'sensitivity', 'detecting', 'csfv', 'concentrations', 'excellent', 'specificity', 'cross-reactivity', 'peptide-based lfa', 'rapid', 'reliable', 'cost-effective diagnostic tool', 'on-site', 'csf', 'surveillance', 'outbreak management']",[]
40684150,COVID-19 infection and its association with severe malaria & dengue: an epidemiological study from Southern India.,"BACKGROUND: Post-Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) sequelae involve complex biological processes that can alter the progression and clinical outcome of other infectious diseases. However, there is no documented information on the influence of COVID-19 on the development of severe malaria and dengue. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the association between malaria & dengue and previous COVID-19 infection among the adult population of Mangalore Taluk and to describe the socio-demographic and clinical correlates of malaria & dengue. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted among 293 participants who were positive for either malaria or dengue from November 2022 to August 2024. Data were collected using a proforma which contained sections on demographic details, clinical profile and comorbidities, history of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination status. The participants were categorised into having severe disease and mild to moderate disease based on operational definitions. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29. Chi-square test was done, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binary Logistic Regression analyses were used and odds ratios were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 293 participants were included in the study with a mean age of 36.7 (SD:14.8) years. Among them, 23.9% (n = 70) had malaria and 76.1% (n = 223) had dengue. Out of those who had malaria, 30% (n = 21) developed severe illness, whereas among those who had dengue 35.8% (n = 80) developed severe dengue. Overall, 58.4% (n = 171) were in the age group of > 30 years. In total, 98.1% (n = 52) of the participants with dengue fever with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe dengue, (aOR:55.93 (95% CI:7.17-435.92) p < 0.001) compared to those without. Similarly, 85.7% (n = 12) of the participants with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe malaria (aOR: 263.7 (95% CI: 34.9-1987.4) p < 0.001) compared to those and these differences were found to be statistically significant. In addition, those participants belonging to lower socio-economic classes had higher chances of developing severe dengue than those belonging to the upper socio-economic class (p < 0.001*).

40682866,"Detection of naturally occuring mixed infection of Theileria lestoquardi and Theileria annulata in buffalo, in Pakistan.","Theileriosis caused by Theileria lestoquardi (malignant ovine theileriosis) in sheep and Theileria annulata (topical theileriosis) in cattle, is a tick-borne hemoprotozoal disease that causes major economic losses in animal production caused by a tick-transmitted haemoprotozoan Theileria species, infecting various domestic and wild animals. It is a threat to the buffalo population in Pakistan due to high mortality rates and economic losses. Extensive mixed farming in Pakistan poses threats due to mixed infections and increased mortality rates. The current case report describes the mixed infection and characterization of Theileria lestoquardi with Theileria annulata in a buffalo raised in a mixed farming setup, in Pakistan. A 6.5-year-old female buffalo presented at the Outdoor Hospital exhibiting swollen sub-scapular lymph nodes, pale mucous membranes, a high fever (41.5 degrees C), dullness, depression, shortness of breath, and a decrease in milk production. Investigation through microscopy, hematology, and PCR confirmed that the buffalo was suffering from theileriosis. A Giemsa-stained thin blood smear showed piroplasms indicating theileriosis. Hematological analysis of the blood revealed lower values for hemoglobin and red blood cells (RBCs), while higher counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes were observed during the infection. The PCR performed on the blood sample was positive for Theileria spp. using RLB universal primers and T. annulata-specific primers. The sequence revealed similarity with T. lestoquardi reported in Pakistan, Iran, Tunisia, and India. The buffalo was treated with Bupralex(R) and Oxtra LA(R) at a dosage of 1ml/20kg of body weight I/M, respectively, along with supportive treatment. Despite these interventions, the animal died probably due to damage to cardiac muscles. This study reports the first case of T. annulata mixed infection with T. lestoquardi in a buffalo in Punjab, Pakistan. It can be concluded that mixed farming exacerbates the epidemiology and spread of ovine malignant theileriosis and mortalities possibly due to cardiac arrest in mixed infections.",2025 Jul 13,"['theileriosis', 'theileria lestoquardi', 'malignant ovine theileriosis', 'sheep', 'theileria annulata', 'topical theileriosis', 'cattle', 'tick-borne hemoprotozoal disease', 'economic losses', 'animal production', 'tick-transmitted haemoprotozoan theileria species', 'infecting', 'domestic', 'wild animals', 'threat', 'buffalo population', 'pakistan', 'mortality rates', 'economic losses', 'farming', 'pakistan', 'threats', 'infections', 'increased', 'mortality rates', 'case report', 'mixed infection', 'characterization', 'theileria lestoquardi', 'theileria annulata', 'buffalo', 'farming', 'pakistan', 'female buffalo', 'outdoor hospital', 'swollen', 'pale mucous membranes', 'high fever', 'dullness', 'depression', 'shortness of breath', 'decrease', 'milk production', 'investigation', 'microscopy', 'hematology', 'pcr', 'buffalo', 'suffering', 'theileriosis', 'giemsa-stained thin', 'piroplasms', 'theileriosis', 'hematological analysis', 'blood', 'hemoglobin', 'red blood cells', 'rbcs', 'counts', 'lymphocytes', 'neutrophils', 'monocytes', 'infection', 'pcr', 'blood sample', 'positive', 'theileria spp', 'rlb', 'primers', 't. annulata-specific primers', 'sequence', 'similarity', 't. lestoquardi', 'pakistan', 'iran', 'tunisia', 'india', 'buffalo', 'treated with', 'bupralex(r)', 'oxtra la(r)', 'dosage', 'body weight i/m', 'supportive treatment', 'interventions', 'animal', 'died', 'damage', 'cardiac muscles', 'study', 't. annulata', 'mixed infection', 't. lestoquardi', 'buffalo', 'punjab', 'pakistan', 'farming', 'exacerbates', 'epidemiology', 'spread', 'ovine', 'mortalities', 'cardiac arrest', 'infections']","['India', 'Mali', 'Pakistan', 'Tunisia']"
40682584,Stent Infection Leading to Coronary Aneurysm and Coronary Cameral Fistula.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary stent infection (SI) is a rare but catastrophic complication, occurring in 0.3% to 6% of cases post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old man underwent PCI for an inferior wall myocardial infarction to the left circumflex artery (LCx) with a single sirolimus-eluting stent. He developed a fever 10 days later due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Imaging showed a coronary cameral fistula with a left atrial appendage (LAA) mycotic aneurysm. He was treated with antibiotics, stent explantation, abscess drainage, and fistula repair; however, he developed refractory vasoplegia and died 2 days post-surgery. DISCUSSION: Coronary SI requires a high index of suspicion. The use of multimodality imaging and multidisciplinary approaches to diagnose and manage infection is essential. Late and complicated stent infections have a high mortality rate. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Coronary SI is an important differential diagnosis for fever post-PCI. Prompt diagnosis, multimodality imaging, and early intervention are needed.",2025 Jun 20,"['background', 'coronary stent infection', 'rare', 'catastrophic', 'complication', 'cases', 'post-percutaneous coronary intervention', 'pci', 'early diagnosis', 'surgical interventions', 'definitive', 'diagnosis', 'management', 'man', 'pci', 'inferior wall myocardial infarction', 'left circumflex artery', 'lcx', 'sirolimus-eluting', 'stent', 'fever', 'days', 'methicillin-sensitive', 'staphylococcus aureus', 'imaging', 'coronary cameral fistula', 'left atrial appendage', 'laa', 'mycotic aneurysm', 'treated with', 'antibiotics', 'stent explantation', 'abscess drainage', 'fistula repair', 'refractory', 'vasoplegia', 'died', 'days', 'post-surgery', 'coronary si', 'suspicion', 'multimodality imaging', 'multidisciplinary approaches', 'diagnose', 'manage', 'infection', 'essential', 'late', 'complicated', 'stent infections', 'mortality rate', 'coronary si', 'differential diagnosis', 'fever', 'post-pci', 'prompt diagnosis', 'multimodality imaging', 'early intervention']",[]

40675253,"Outbreak of leptospirosis caused by Leptospira wolffii with HAV coinfections in lower Assam, Northeast India in 2024: Clinical impact and public health implications.","BACKGROUND: In February-March 2024, an outbreak of unknown fever and jaundice with multiple fatalities was reported in Goalpara District, Assam, India. This study aimed to identify the etiological agents responsible for the outbreak to guide public health interventions. METHODS: Clinical samples from 30 individuals were collected and analyzed using serological and molecular techniques. Serological testing for Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), and Leptospira was performed using IgM ELISA kits. Leptospira DNA was extracted and amplified using PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for further analysis. RESULTS: The results revealed HAV IgM antibodies in 23.33 % of cases (7/30), while 40 % (12/30) tested positive for Leptospira-specific IgM by ELISA. Additionally, PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene confirmed Leptospira DNA in 53.33 % of the urine samples (8/15). Notably, 16.67 % (5/30) of cases exhibited coinfection with both HAV and Leptospira spp., challenging the clinical outcome. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of PCR-positive samples identified Leptospira wolffii (L. wolffii) as the causative agent, marking the first report of L. wolffii in human clinical samples from Northeastern India. Recently, L. wolffii, a member of the P2 subclade of Leptospira, has garnered attention due to its pathogenic potential. CONCLUSION: The findings along with reported fatalities, emphasize the pathogenic potential of L. wolffii and its likely introduction into the region, via cross-border transmission from neighboring Bangladesh, where the strain is prevalent. This study highlights the need for enhanced surveillance and research to monitor emerging Leptospira strains, particularly L. wolffii, in both human and animal populations, to better understand its epidemiology, pathogenicity, and public health implications.",2025 Jul 15,"['background', 'february-march', 'outbreak', 'unknown', 'fever', 'jaundice', 'multiple', 'fatalities', 'goalpara district', 'assam', 'india', 'study', 'etiological agents', 'outbreak', 'public', 'clinical samples', 'individuals', 'collected', 'analyzed', 'serological', 'molecular techniques', 'serological testing', 'hepatitis a virus', 'hav', 'hepatitis e virus', 'hev', 'leptospira', 'igm elisa kits', 'leptospira dna', 'amplified', 'pcr', 'targeting', '16s rrna gene', 'next-generation sequencing', 'ngs', 'analysis', 'results', 'hav', 'cases', 'positive', 'leptospira-specific igm', 'elisa', 'pcr', 'targeting', '16s rrna', 'leptospira dna', 'urine samples', 'cases', 'coinfection', 'hav', 'leptospira spp', 'clinical outcome', 'sequencing', 'phylogenetic analysis', 'pcr-positive', 'samples', 'leptospira wolffii', 'l. wolffii', 'causative agent', 'l. wolffii', 'human', 'clinical samples', 'northeastern india', 'l. wolffii', 'p2 subclade', 'leptospira', 'pathogenic', 'potential', 'findings', 'fatalities', 'pathogenic', 'potential', 'l. wolffii', 'introduction', 'region', 'cross-border transmission', 'neighboring', 'bangladesh', 'strain', 'study', 'enhanced', 'surveillance', 'research', 'leptospira strains', 'l. wolffii', 'human', 'animal populations', 'epidemiology', 'pathogenicity', 'public health']","['Bangladesh', 'India']"

40665219,The global burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever from 1990 to 2021 and the impact on prevention and control.,"BACKGROUND: Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are common infectious diseases and remain a heavy burden, especially in some low-income countries. Although the global burden has decreased over the past three decades, an analysis of the burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever will help inform public health strategies. METHODS: This study is aimed to comprehensively evaluate the global, regional, and national burden of typhoid and paratyphoid, and the temporal trends while exploring potential associations with socio-demographic development over three decades (1990-2021). Data on typhoid and paratyphoid fever were analyzed using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2021. For this analysis, we calculated to demonstrate temporal trends in the incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of typhoid and paratyphoid fever from 1990 to 2021. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, both typhoid and paratyphoid fever showed declining trends globally and in different socio-demographic index (SDI) regions, including incidence, mortality, and DALYs. For typhoid fever worldwide, new cases decreased by 62.12%, with an EAPC of -3.92 (-4.14, -3.71); deaths decreased by 50.65%, EAPC - 2.83 (-2.99, -2.66), and DALYs decreased by 52.30%, EAPC - 2.82 (-3.00, -2.64). For paratyphoid fever, new cases decreased by 73.15%, with an EAPC of -4.77 (-5.29, -4.26); deaths decreased by 65.44%, EAPC - 3.74 (-4.24, -3.24), and DALYs decreased by 68.42%, EAPC - 3.87 (-4.42, -3.31). For both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, children had the highest morbidity and mortality rates; males had higher rates of incidence, mortality, and DALYs than females. However, among older patients, the absolute number of new cases and DALYs was higher in women. The burden is concentrated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, with only South Asia suffering severely from paratyphoid fever. Regarding typhoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of incidence are Burkina Faso (328.48) (SDI: 0.285), Bangladesh (303.14) (SDI: 0.492), and Papua New Guinea (299.45) (SDI: 418) which are in Western Sub-Saharan, South Asia, and Oceania. The top three countries in terms of mortality and DALYs are Bhutan (5.61; 434.23) (SDI: 0.473), Bangladesh (5.06; 382.38), and Burkina Faso (4.64; 352.57). Regarding paratyphoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of mortality and DALYs are the same, including Pakistan (1.05; 72.66), India (0.75; 53.42), and Nepal (0.72; 50.65) (SDI: 0.433), all of which are located in South Asia.",2025 Jul 15,"['background', 'typhoid', 'paratyphoid fever', 'infectious diseases', 'heavy burden', 'low-income countries', 'global burden', 'decreased', 'decades', 'analysis', 'burden', 'typhoid', 'paratyphoid fever', 'public health', 'study', 'evaluate', 'global', 'regional', 'national burden', 'typhoid', 'paratyphoid', 'temporal', 'trends', 'associations', 'socio-demographic development', 'decades', 'data', 'typhoid', 'paratyphoid fever', 'analyzed', 'global burden of disease', 'study', 'analysis', 'temporal', 'trends', 'incidence', 'mortality', 'disability', 'life years', 'dalys', 'typhoid', 'paratyphoid fever', 'typhoid', 'paratyphoid fever', 'declining', 'trends', 'socio-demographic index', 'incidence', 'mortality', 'dalys', 'typhoid fever', 'cases', 'decreased', 'eapc', 'deaths', 'decreased', 'eapc', 'dalys', 'decreased', 'eapc', 'paratyphoid fever', 'cases', 'decreased', 'eapc', 'deaths', 'decreased', 'eapc', 'dalys', 'decreased', 'eapc', 'typhoid', 'paratyphoid fever', 'children', 'highest', 'morbidity', 'mortality rates', 'males', 'rates', 'incidence', 'mortality', 'dalys', 'females', 'older patients', 'absolute', 'cases', 'dalys', 'women', 'burden', 'south asia', 'southeast asia', 'oceania', 'south asia', 'suffering', 'severely', 'paratyphoid fever', 'typhoid fever', 'countries', 'asrs', 'incidence', 'burkina faso', 'sdi', 'bangladesh', 'sdi', 'papua new guinea', 'sdi', 'western sub-saharan', 'south asia', 'oceania', 'countries', 'mortality', 'dalys', 'bhutan', 'sdi', 'bangladesh', 'burkina faso', 'paratyphoid fever', 'countries', 'asrs', 'mortality', 'dalys', 'pakistan', 'india', 'nepal', 'sdi', 'south asia']","['Burkina Faso', 'Bangladesh', 'Bhutan', 'Guinea', 'India', 'Nepal', 'Pakistan', 'Papua New Guinea']"
40662738,Role of cycle threshold values in predicting poor outcomes in patients with Kyasanur Forest disease: a retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic illness endemic to southern India. Early identification of patients at risk for poor outcomes remains a clinical challenge. The study aimed to evaluate the role of cycle threshold (Ct) values in predicting outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with PCR-confirmed KFD admitted to a tertiary care hospital in South India between January 2019 and December 2024. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the prognostic performance of Ct values. RESULTS: Among 213 patients, 20 (9.4%) died. Mortality was independently associated with lower Ct values, older age, lower respiratory tract involvement, altered sensorium, and elevated white blood cell counts on multivariable analysis. ROC analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.675 for Ct value alone. A Ct cut-off >/=27.75 predicted survival with 68.4% sensitivity and 70.0% specificity. CONCLUSION: Lower Ct values are independently associated with increased mortality in KFD and may serve as a pragmatic tool for early risk stratification, especially in resource-limited settings.",2025 Dec,"['background', 'kyasanur forest disease', 'kfd', 'tick-borne', 'viral haemorrhagic illness', 'endemic', 'southern india', 'early identification', 'patients', 'risk', 'poor outcomes', 'clinical challenge', 'study', 'evaluate', 'cycle threshold', 'predicting', 'outcomes', 'retrospective cohort study', 'adults', 'pcr-confirmed', 'kfd', 'admitted', 'tertiary care hospital', 'south india', 'primary outcome', 'mortality', 'univariate', 'multivariable logistic regression analyses', 'independent', 'predictors', 'mortality', 'receiver operating characteristic (roc) analysis', 'prognostic', 'ct values', 'patients', 'died', 'mortality', 'associated with', 'ct values', 'older age', 'lower respiratory tract', 'involvement', 'sensorium', 'elevated', 'multivariable analysis', 'roc analysis', 'area', 'ct value', 'predicted', 'survival', 'sensitivity', 'specificity', 'ct values', 'associated with', 'increased', 'mortality', 'kfd', 'pragmatic tool', 'early', 'risk', 'stratification', 'resource-limited settings']",['India']

A muscle biopsy is confirmatory for the diagnosis. We report a case of a woman in her 30s with scrub typhus and anti-nuclear matrix protein 2 (NXP2) positive PM. The patient presented with fever, proximal muscle weakness, dysphagia and serologically confirmed scrub typhus a month prior. Laboratory investigations revealed a positive ELISA IgM for scrub typhus, elevated creatine kinase and elevated transaminases, leading to a provisional diagnosis of scrub myositis. However, further investigations, including electromyography, nerve conduction studies, muscle biopsy and the detection of myositis-specific anti-NXP-2 antibodies suggested PM. The patient was successfully treated with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, resulting in significant improvement of symptoms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted from February 2023 to August 2024. There were 57 cases of HCC enrolled. Patient details were noted, such as demographics, clinical characteristics, tumor characteristics, disease severity and their treatment. The data was compiled and analyzed. The outcome measures were association of tumor size with AFP levels. RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 63.1 years and a BMI of 27.02 kg/m(2). Common risk factors were diabetes mellitus and alcohol in 47.4% and 43.9%, respectively. The common symptoms were abdominal pain (right hypochondrium) in 40 (70.2%) patients, abdominal distension in 36 (63.2%), jaundice in 19 (33.3%), weight loss in 10 (17.5%), fever in 8 (14.0%). Hepatomegaly was present in 29 (50.9%) patients, ascites in 27 (47.4%), splenomegaly in 10 (17.5%), liver bruit and pleural effusion in 6 (10.5%) patients each, and hepatic encephalopathy in 4 (7.0%) patients. CONCLUSION: HCC patients were primarily older men with diabetes and alcohol being common risk factors. Abdominal pain and distention remain common findings with complications of cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and pleural effusion.

40655376,"Antibacterial Activity, Phytochemical Analysis of C. coggygria Leaf Extracts Against S. typhi, and Computational Studies to Screen Potential Drug Candidates.","Typhoid fever is a serious infectious disease caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A. Although there are several drugs available for the treatment of Salmonella infection, however, the rising cases of bacterial resistance against common drugs necessitate new drug discovery against S. typhi. So Typhoid fever can be managed in a better way. Therefore we carried out the phytochemical analysis of Cotinus coggygria by FTIR and GC-MS analysis followed by antibacterial activity against S. typhi. Moreover, We also conducted molecular docking to find out important phytochemicals; methanol (48 compounds) and ethyl acetate (66 compounds) and 6 molecular targets; glycosidehydrolase (PDB Id: 4hzm), OmpF (PDB Id; 4kra), DNA gyrase (PDB Id;5ZTJ), AvrA (PDB Id; 6BE0), RamR (PDB Id; 6IE9), and tryptophan Synthase (PDB Id; 7L03). Results show that the ethyl acetate extracts of C. coggygria have the highest antibacterial activity against S. typhi, with inhibition zones ranging from 23 +/- 2.8 to 18 +/- 0.5 mm at different concentrations as compared to methanol extracts. Based on the docking score, DNA gyrase (5ZTJ) was found as the most suitable molecular target. DNA gyrase (5ZTJ). Further molecular dynamics simulation study resulted in 7 potential inhibitors from ethyl acetate extract and 5 potential inhibitors from methanol extracts as they had lower free binding energy than the reference drug ciprofloxacin. Based on this study we conclude that the top four phytochemicals that may be used for therapeutic purposes and drug development against salmonella activity are Lanosterol, Lup-20(29)-en-3-one, 9,19-Cyclolanost-24-en-3-ol, (3. beta.)-), and Periplogenin acetate.",2025 Jun,"['typhoid fever', 'infectious disease', 'salmonella typhi', 'salmonella paratyphi', 'drugs', 'treatment', 'salmonella infection', 'cases', 'bacterial resistance', 'drugs', 'drug discovery', 's. typhi', 'typhoid fever', 'phytochemical analysis', 'cotinus coggygria', 'ftir', 'gc-ms analysis', 'antibacterial activity', 's. typhi', 'molecular docking', 'phytochemicals', 'methanol', 'compounds', 'ethyl acetate', 'compounds', 'molecular targets', 'glycosidehydrolase', 'pdb id', 'ompf', 'pdb id', 'dna gyrase', 'pdb', 'avra', 'pdb id', 'ramr', 'pdb id', 'tryptophan synthase', 'pdb id', 'ethyl acetate', 'extracts', 'c. coggygria', 'antibacterial activity', 's. typhi', 'inhibition', 'concentrations', 'methanol', 'extracts', 'docking score', 'dna gyrase', '5ztj', 'molecular target', 'dna gyrase', '5ztj', 'molecular dynamics simulation study', 'potential', 'inhibitors', 'ethyl acetate extract', 'potential', 'inhibitors', 'methanol', 'extracts', 'drug', 'study', 'phytochemicals', 'therapeutic purposes', 'drug development', 'salmonella activity', 'lanosterol', 'lup-20(29)-en-3-one', 'periplogenin acetate']",[]
40652474,"Neurological Manifestations of Scrub Typhus: The Clinical Spectrum, Determinants, and Outcome.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neurological involvement is reported in up to a quarter of patients with scrub typhus. However, prospective studies accurately describing clinical findings, temporal evolution, and rare syndromes are sparse. This study characterized scrub typhus-associated neurological syndromes, emphasizing neurological localization, clinical outcomes, and potential predictors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients admitted to a medical college hospital with scrub typhus during a 1-year period. Detailed clinical, laboratory, and radiological profiles and outcomes were documented and analyzed. RESULTS: Among 198 patients included, whose median age was 47 years (range, 18-85 years), 48.5% were men. The mean duration of fever before presentation was 8.2 days. Neurological deficits attributable to scrub typhus were present in 31.3% of patients. The commonest syndrome was meningitis/meningoencephalitis (87.9%). Extrapyramidal disorders occurred in 10%, and cerebellar disorders occurred in 3%. Extrapyramidal disorders often developed during the acute stage and persisted into early convalescence. Ischemic stroke and new-onset peripheral neuropathies occurred in two and three patients, respectively. Parameters in patients with and without neurological manifestations were compared. Multivariate analysis revealed that male sex, headache, vomiting, and elevated creatinine increased the odds of neurological involvement.

OBJECTIVES: To identify the clinico-epidemiological characteristics, management, and outcomes of severe dengue fever among inpatients of a tertiary care hospital. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital, Karnataka. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study included all laboratory-confirmed adult dengue patients admitted to Departments of General Medicine and Infectious Diseases during the study period. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and analysed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Descriptive and analytical tests, including multiple logistic regression analyses, were performed. RESULTS: Among 443 patients, 70% were males. Fever (91.9%) and aches/pains (81.7%) were most frequently reported symptoms with thrombocytopenia (81.9%), elevated AST (81.2%), and ALT (73.3%) were commonly observed. Severe dengue was observed in 12.1% of patients, frequently accompanied by acute kidney injury (32.9%), hepatitis (29.4%), and multiple organ dysfunction (22.4%). Severe cases were associated with age over 60 (COR = 4.6; 95% CI:2.1-9.9), low education status (COR = 3.6; 95% CI:1.3-10.4), unskilled occupations (COR = 4.2; 95% CI:1.1-15.8), presence of co-morbidities (COR = 2.5; 95% CI:1.4-4.4) and co-infections (COR = 5.2;95% CI:2.7-9.8), and supportive treatment (COR = 3.9; 95% CI:2.1-7). Independent predictor for severity was coinfection (AOR = 15.6; 95% CI:3.9-61.7). Supportive care was received by 36.3% patients, with 97.5% showing improvement, while 1.6% succumbed to death.

40646441,"Acute undifferentiated febrile illness in a traveler returning from Burkina Faso, West Africa to Puducherry, India- a case report.","BACKGROUND: Imported malaria remains a significant diagnostic challenge, particularly in regions approaching elimination. This case report is novel in its exploration of the complexities involved in diagnosing malaria imported from a high-endemic area to a low-endemic region, emphasizing the critical role of detailed travel history and molecular diagnostics in identifying the disease. The case underscores the potential public health implications of missing such diagnoses in regions where routine malaria testing is not performed due to low endemicity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old male presented to a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry, India, with symptoms of intermittent fever, headache, loss of appetite, and vomiting, which persisted over a week. Initial laboratory findings showed thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, with negative tests for dengue, chikungunya, and scrub typhus. Further investigation using molecular diagnostic techniques identified Plasmodium falciparum. The patient had recently returned from Burkina Faso, West Africa, where he had experienced similar episodes of fever, establishing the diagnosis of imported malaria. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the necessity of considering imported malaria in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses in India, a country nearing malaria elimination. It illustrates the importance of incorporating travel history into clinical evaluations and supports the use of molecular diagnostics to effectively diagnose malaria in settings where traditional diagnostic methods may overlook imported cases. The findings advocate for enhanced surveillance and diagnostic preparedness to manage imported cases of malaria, thereby supporting ongoing elimination efforts and preventing the re-establishment of local transmission.

Currently, the available vaccines/drugs have posed profound toxicity and limited efficacy leading to limited therapeutic options. Herein, our study sheds light on a novel anti-dengue agent made of lipidic phytocompounds extracted from Breynia vitis-idaea leaves, which were isolated and analyzed for their larvicidal potential against the Aedes mosquito. The isolated prime compounds, namely, eicosanic acid ethyl ester and ethyl 3-methylpentanoate were characterized using UV, FT-IR, mass, (1)H, and (13)C NMR spectroscopic techniques to confirm their molecular structures. The structural orientation was performed using the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ basis set method. The effectiveness of the isolated compounds and their inhibitory mechanisms against Aedes methyl transferase-converting enzyme (MTase) were investigated by in silico studies and proven to be of significant binding potential with a key molecular target, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), for mosquitocides and dengue methyltransferase.

40641555,Suboptimal dengue genome leverages non-canonical translation mechanisms.,"Dengue is a notable example of vector-borne RNA virus responsible for severe hemorrhagic fever. Its compact genome necessitates reliance on the host's translational machinery for replication. This study investigates the plausible adaptive strategies employed by dengue serotypes for effective translation within the human host. By analyzing viral reads from the RNA-seq dataset derived from the hospital-admitted patients, we explored the impact of dinucleotide diversity on codon optimization, and compatibility of serotypes with the host. Our findings reveal only moderate congruency of serotypes with the host and identified genomic composition common to several RNA viruses. Notably, unique coverage patterns were observed within the genome of DENV-2 serotypes. Using ribosome profileing (Ribo-seq) data, we extended our analysis to assess the translatability of potential internal open reading frames (iORFs) identified in the RNA-seq dataset. Nine common iORFs were identified across both the datasets, underscoring potential non-canonical translational mechanisms that might enhance DENV genome optimization.",2025 May 16,"['dengue', 'vector-borne', 'severe', 'hemorrhagic fever', 'compact genome', ""host's"", 'translational machinery', 'replication', 'study', 'investigates', 'adaptive strategies', 'dengue', 'serotypes', 'effective', 'translation', 'human', 'host', 'viral reads', 'rna-seq', 'dataset', 'hospital-admitted', 'patients', 'impact', 'dinucleotide diversity', 'codon', 'optimization', 'compatibility', 'serotypes', 'host', 'findings', 'moderate', 'congruency', 'serotypes', 'host', 'identified', 'genomic composition', 'rna viruses', 'coverage', 'patterns', 'genome', 'denv-2', 'serotypes', 'ribosome profileing', 'ribo-seq', 'data', 'analysis', 'translatability', 'potential', 'internal open reading frames', 'iorfs', 'rna-seq', 'dataset', 'iorfs', 'datasets', 'non-canonical translational', 'mechanisms', 'denv', 'genome', 'optimization']",[]
40640746,A comprehensive overview of patient journey and management decision pathway for myelofibrosis in India: INLAND survey.,"BACKGROUND: Myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferative and anomalous production of cytokines with genetic mutations in the JAK/STAT signalling pathway playing a distinctive role in its pathophysiology. Diagnosis of MF presents a challenge due to vague and overlapping symptoms. The present strategy for managing MF is not well defined and relies on a symptomatic approach. Ruxolitinib is the first drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2011. Drug Controller General of India approved Ruxolitinib in 2013 as a first-line treatment in patients with MF. This comprehensive survey aims to understand the MF patient journey and the perceptions/practices of Indian hematologists/oncologists regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and disease management of myelofibrosis. METHODS: A cross-sectional, multicentric, qualitative survey was conducted across 17 Indian cities from October 2021 to November 2021. One-on-one telephonic interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire based on the study objective. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the obtained data. RESULTS: Overall, 50 physicians and 154 patients (primary MF: 51, post-PV: 78 and post-ET: 25) completed the survey. The most common symptoms reported by patients and physicians at the time of diagnosis were, abdominal pain/discomfort (81% vs. 70%), fatigue/tiredness/weakness (77% vs. 73%) and fever (54% vs. 48%). A 10-month delay was observed from the symptom onset to the final diagnosis and a further 9-month lag from final diagnosis to treatment initiation. In our survey, the physicians preferred Hydroxyurea (88%), blood transfusion (82%) and Ruxolitinib (78%) as the treatment regimen. The majority of the patients were aware of their treatment. Hydroxyurea constituted the predominant treatment option (n = 85); however, satisfaction was highest with Ruxolitinib (50%, n = 13). The physicians considered improving overall survival as an important treatment goal, while patients prioritized symptom relief. CONCLUSION: The survey highlights the importance of understanding symptom burden and treatment goal perceptions in shaping management decisions. The results emphasize the need to align the physicians and patients on the actual treatment outcomes through patient education. Strengthening this alignment will enhance treatment adherence, improve patient satisfaction, and ensure better clinical outcomes, ultimately leading to a more patient-centred approach to managing the disease.",2025 Jul 10,"['background', 'myelofibrosis', 'myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'stem', 'clonal myeloproliferative', 'anomalous', 'production', 'cytokines', 'genetic mutations', 'jak/stat signalling pathway', 'pathophysiology', 'diagnosis', 'vague', 'symptoms', 'managing', 'symptomatic', 'ruxolitinib', 'drug', 'united states food and drug administration', 'drug controller', 'india', 'ruxolitinib', 'first-line treatment', 'patients', 'comprehensive', 'survey', 'patient', 'perceptions/practices', 'indian', 'hematologists/oncologists', 'diagnosis', 'prognosis', 'disease management', 'myelofibrosis', 'cross-sectional', 'multicentric', 'qualitative survey', 'indian', 'cities', 'one-on-one telephonic interviews', 'structured questionnaire', 'study', 'descriptive statistics', 'data', 'physicians', 'patients', 'primary', 'post-pv', 'post-et', 'survey', 'symptoms', 'patients', 'physicians', 'time', 'diagnosis', 'abdominal pain/discomfort', 'fatigue/tiredness/weakness', 'fever', 'delay', 'symptom onset', 'diagnosis', 'diagnosis', 'treatment initiation', 'survey', 'physicians', 'hydroxyurea', 'blood transfusion', 'ruxolitinib', 'treatment regimen', 'patients', 'treatment', 'hydroxyurea', 'predominant', 'treatment', 'satisfaction', 'ruxolitinib', 'physicians', 'improving', 'overall survival', 'treatment goal', 'patients', 'symptom relief', 'survey', 'symptom', 'burden', 'treatment', 'perceptions', 'management', 'decisions', 'results', 'physicians', 'patients', 'actual', 'treatment', 'patient education', 'alignment', 'treatment', 'adherence', 'improve', 'patient satisfaction', 'clinical outcomes', 'patient-centred approach', 'disease']","['India', 'United States']"

In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of oral AT-752 (750 mg thrice daily for 5 days) compared with a placebo in 21 adults with confirmed dengue infection. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in viral load via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing, with assessments performed daily on Days 1-8, 14, and 28. The primary endpoint was nonevaluable because many patients presented late during the course of disease, with low baseline viremia levels precluding accurate quantification at subsequent timepoints. In the as-treated population (patients with assessment at baseline and at each post-baseline timepoint), the numerical mean reduction (versus baseline) in viral load on Day 4 was greater in the AT-752 group than the placebo group (P = 0.0022). The median time to a sustained resolution of fever (the major clinical sign of dengue) was 4 days in the AT-752 group compared with >5 days in the placebo group; the reduction in oral temperature at the Day 4 timepoint was greater in the AT-752 group (treatment difference: 0.84 degrees C; P = 0.0322). There was a trend toward faster platelet recovery in the AT-752 group compared with the placebo group, and proportionally fewer patients in the AT-752 group underwent hospitalization for disease progression (one patient in each group). AT-752 exhibited favorable safety and tolerability; the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate, and Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred at similar rates in both groups.

This case presents an uncommon presentation of Burkholderia cepacia complex infection in a pseudocyst, particularly in an immunocompetent host, which provides a unique insight into the novel properties of the bacteria, including elevated endotoxin-like lipopolysaccharide activity, which is essential in the pathogenesis in this case or similar presentations.",2025,"['atypical', 'occurrence', 'burkholderia', 'cenocepacia-infected pancreatic pseudocyst', 'immunocompetent', 'patient', 'male', 'clinic', 'history', 'sudden-onset', 'abdominal pain', 'fever', 'days', 'examination', 'soft abdomen', 'epigastric', 'left lumbar tenderness', 'guarding', 'abdominal ultrasound', 'gaseous abdomen', 'mild', 'hepatosplenomegaly', 'anechoic collections', 'pancreas', 'septations', 'suspected', 'pseudocysts', 'uncinate process', 'body', 'pancreas', 'pigtail catheter', 'drain', 'pus-filled cyst', 'fluid culture', 'positive', 'ceftazidime-sensitive burkholderia cenocepacia', 'maldi-tof of growth', 'culture', 'blood', 'mcconkey agar', 'regimen', 'inj ceftazidime', 'days', 'pigtail catheter', 'drain', 'pancreatic', 'drained fluid', 'days', 'patient', 'discharged', 'presentation', 'burkholderia cepacia complex infection', 'pseudocyst', 'immunocompetent', 'host', 'novel', 'properties', 'bacteria', 'elevated', 'endotoxin-like lipopolysaccharide', 'activity', 'pathogenesis', 'case', 'presentations']",[]
40636170,Challenging trends in clinical-epidemiology and sero-prevalence of leptospirosis among febrile patients.,"Leptospirosis is the most prevalent zoonotic illness that affects both humans and animals worldwide. It is typically underreported due to a lack of knowledge, unusual manifestations and a lack of diagnostic resources. Therefore, it is of interest to estimate the seroprevalence of Leptospirosis from an acute febrile illness patient at a tertiary care hospital in India. Hence, a total of 252 blood samples were collected out of which 39 (15.47%) were positive for leptospirosis IgM antibody. Male patient (56.75%) shows preponderance over females. Further patients among the age group groups 21-40 (56.41%) showed the positivity. A clinical presentation such as Fever (100%), Myalgia (51.5%) and Headache (36.98%) was the most common symptoms seen followed by vomiting and abdominal pain.

40636068,Efficacy of prophylactic enteral bromocriptine in reducing the neurogenic fever in severe traumatic brain injury patients in the trauma intensive care unit - A randomized placebo-controlled study.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurogenic fever (NF) is a noninfectious, centrally mediated hyperthermia seen in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other neurological conditions. Fever exacerbates secondary brain injury, increases metabolic demand, and worsens patient outcomes. Dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine, which modulate hypothalamic thermoregulation, have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents. This study evaluates the efficacy of prophylactic bromocriptine in preventing NF in patients with severe TBI. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 100 adult patients with isolated severe TBI admitted within 24 h of injury were assigned to receive either bromocriptine (5 mg twice daily, n = 50) or placebo (n = 50) through enteral administration. NF was defined as a temperature >38.3 degrees C for at least one episode over 2 consecutive days after excluding infectious causes. The primary outcome was NF incidence. Secondary outcomes included fever severity, frequency, onset, mortality, and heart rate-temperature correlation. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistical methods. RESULTS: After exclusions and dropouts, 43 patients in the bromocriptine group and 45 in the placebo group were analyzed. NF incidence was lower in the bromocriptine group (41.86%) compared to placebo (55.56%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.199). No differences were observed in fever onset, mortality, or heart rate-temperature correlation. Bromocriptine was associated with a reduction in peak temperature on day 5 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Prophylactic bromocriptine did not significantly reduce NF incidence in severe TBI but showed trends toward lower fever severity.

(XO) is invariably pathological. This lesion tends to extend into the adjacent soft tissues, mimicking malignancy. Non-specific symptoms associated are pain at the site of involvement, fever, leukocytosis, increased C-reactive-Reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). A Hallmark feature is the presence of lipid-laden macrophages or histiocytes, with acute and chronic inflammatory cells, in the histopathology. Infective organisms are identified rarely by culture, That is, usually sterile. CASE REPORT: We discuss here a case of (XO) of the right hip joint, a 38-year-old male patient presented with right hip pain throbbing type, which was insidious in onset. Accompanying symptoms included evening rise in temperature, loss of weight, and loss of appetite. The patient had a history of trauma for which he was treated with native splinting for 3 months.

Acute on chronic osteomyelitis refers to the exacerbation of symptoms in a patient with an underlying chronic infection. This case report presents a 19-year-old male diagnosed with acute on chronic osteomyelitis of the right distal femur, with no history of a discharging sinus for the past 6 months. Osteomyelitis is a bone infection commonly caused by bacteria, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent pathogen. Chronic osteomyelitis can occasionally experience acute flare-ups, referred to as ""acute on chronic osteomyelitis"". This report discusses the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a 19-year-old male with acute on chronic osteomyelitis of the right distal femur. CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old male presented with increasing pain, swelling, and warmth over his right distal femur for 2 weeks. The pain was deep, throbbing, worsened by weight-bearing, and unrelieved by analgesics. He had similar complaints 6 months ago but had no symptoms such as fever or discharging sinus since then. There was no history of trauma or injury. On physical examination, the patient exhibited localized tenderness, mild swelling, broadening, irregularity, and warmth over the distal femur. Movements of the knee were restricted, and pain was elicited with direct palpation of the femur. No open wounds or discharging sinuses were present, and neurological and vascular examinations were unremarkable.Radiographs of the right femur showed sclerosis and focal cortical thickening, indicating chronic osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of marrow edema, cortical irregularity, and periosteal reaction, supporting the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis with an acute exacerbation. Blood tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, indicating an acute inflammatory response. The patient received intravenous antibiotics preoperatively, followed by sequestrectomy, saucerization, and stimulan placement over the site where necrotic bone was removed to promote healing. Over 6 weeks, the patient experienced significant improvement in symptoms. Repeat imaging showed resolution of the acute infection, and long-term oral antibiotics were prescribed to manage chronic osteomyelitis.This case emphasizes the challenges of diagnosing and treating acute on chronic osteomyelitis, particularly when typical signs like a discharging sinus are absent. Early diagnosis and prompt, targeted antibiotic therapy is crucial for preventing complications such as deformities, limb loss, or sepsis. CONCLUSION: Effective management of acute on chronic osteomyelitis requires comprehensive evaluation through clinical history, imaging, and laboratory testing. Early intervention with surgical debridement and appropriate antibiotic therapy is vital to achieving favorable outcomes and preventing long-term complications.",2025 Jul,"['osteomyelitis', 'bone infection', 'acutely', 'chronically', 'acute', 'chronic osteomyelitis', 'exacerbation', 'symptoms', 'patient', 'chronic infection', 'case report', 'male', 'diagnosed', 'acute', 'chronic osteomyelitis of the right distal femur', 'no history', 'discharging sinus', 'months', 'osteomyelitis', 'bone infection', 'bacteria', 'staphylococcus aureus', 'frequent', 'pathogen', 'chronic osteomyelitis', 'acute', 'acute', 'chronic osteomyelitis', 'report', 'presentation', 'diagnosis', 'management', 'male', 'acute', 'chronic osteomyelitis of the right distal femur', 'male', 'increasing', 'pain', 'swelling', 'warmth', 'right distal femur', 'weeks', 'pain', 'deep', 'throbbing', 'worsened', 'weight-bearing', 'unrelieved', 'analgesics', 'complaints', 'months', 'symptoms', 'fever', 'discharging sinus', 'trauma', 'injury', 'physical examination', 'patient', 'localized tenderness', 'mild swelling', 'broadening', 'irregularity', 'warmth', 'distal femur', 'movements', 'knee', 'restricted', 'pain', 'palpation', 'femur', 'open wounds', 'discharging sinuses', 'neurological', 'vascular examinations', 'unremarkable', 'radiographs', 'right femur', 'sclerosis', 'focal cortical thickening', 'chronic osteomyelitis', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'presence', 'marrow edema', 'cortical irregularity', 'periosteal reaction', 'diagnosis', 'chronic osteomyelitis', 'acute exacerbation', 'blood tests', 'elevated', 'white blood cell count', 'c-reactive protein', 'acute', 'patient', 'intravenous', 'preoperatively', 'sequestrectomy', 'saucerization', 'stimulan placement', 'site', 'necrotic bone', 'promote', 'healing', 'weeks', 'patient', 'improvement', 'symptoms', 'imaging', 'resolution', 'acute infection', 'long-term', 'oral antibiotics', 'prescribed', 'chronic osteomyelitis', 'diagnosing', 'treating', 'acute', 'chronic osteomyelitis', 'signs', 'discharging sinus', 'absent', 'early diagnosis', 'prompt', 'targeted antibiotic therapy', 'preventing', 'complications', 'deformities', 'limb loss', 'sepsis', 'effective', 'management', 'acute', 'chronic osteomyelitis', 'comprehensive', 'evaluation', 'clinical history', 'imaging', 'laboratory testing', 'early intervention', 'surgical debridement', 'antibiotic therapy', 'favorable outcomes', 'long-term', 'complications']",[]
40635807,Perioperative challenges and management strategies for non-cardiac surgery in patients with rheumatic heart diseases: A narrative review.,"Rheumatic heart diseases (RHDs) impose a substantial global burden, primarily affecting individuals under 25 years of age in low- and medium-income countries (LMICs) and poor and marginalized groups in high-income countries.[123] The underlying cause is a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, which triggers an immune-mediated attack on the heart and joints. Although acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is treatable, its occurrence and complications remain high in impoverished areas.[4] Variations in social structure contribute to differences in the incidence and progression of the disease, even in affluent regions.[5] Administering anesthesia to this patient population presents significant challenges, particularly when early management has been inadequate due to limited medical care and follow-up. Literature shows evidence for anesthetic management of different types of RHDs, mostly focusing on mitral and aortic valvulopathies.[67] This review synthesizes literature from databases such as MEDLINE and PubMed searches from the year 2000 to date, focusing on anesthesia management strategies and the challenges posed by ARF and RHD. Specific topics covered include the diagnosis and management of ARF, acute complications, perioperative care for patients with RHD, and unique considerations for different valvular pathologiesWith this review, we aim to discuss the available evidence, current World Health Organization (WHO) and societal guidelines in the context of perioperative medical and anesthetic management, hemodynamic challenges, and postoperative courses.

40635225,An Unusual Adverse Drug Reaction to Thalidomide: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND: Thalidomide has emerged as a novel antitumor drug with antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory properties. It was taken off the market in the early 1960s due to its infamous connection with congenital defects. Recently, the FDA approved thalidomide for treating erythema nodosum leprosum, adhering to strict guidelines and safety measures. Sensory peripheral neuropathy and teratogenicity, fatigue, vertigo, headache, gastrointestinal issues, skin eruptions, dizziness, galactorrhoea, decreased libido, and constitutional symptoms like fever, weakness, headaches, and weight loss are the main adverse effects of thalidomide. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 46-year-old female diagnosed with lepromatous leprosy on multibacillary multidrug therapy presenting with unusual adverse reactions, such as generalized burning sensation, breathlessness, and low backache after the intake of thalidomide. CONCLUSION: We describe an unusual adverse reaction to thalidomide that has not previously been reported in the literature and aim to alert clinicians about the unusual, adverse reaction as an uncommon side effect of thalidomide and to always keep in mind if the patient develops any of these symptoms.",2025 Jul 8,"['background', 'thalidomide', 'antitumor', 'antiangiogenic', 'immunomodulatory', 'market', 'connection', 'congenital defects', 'fda', 'thalidomide', 'treating', 'erythema nodosum leprosum', 'guidelines', 'safety measures', 'sensory peripheral neuropathy', 'teratogenicity', 'fatigue', 'vertigo', 'headache', 'gastrointestinal issues', 'skin eruptions', 'dizziness', 'galactorrhoea', 'decreased', 'libido', 'constitutional symptoms', 'fever', 'weakness', 'headaches', 'weight loss', 'adverse effects', 'thalidomide', 'case', 'female', 'diagnosed', 'lepromatous leprosy', 'multibacillary multidrug therapy', 'unusual', 'adverse reactions', 'generalized burning sensation', 'breathlessness', 'low backache', 'intake', 'thalidomide', 'unusual', 'adverse reaction', 'thalidomide', 'literature', 'clinicians', 'unusual', 'adverse reaction', 'side effect', 'thalidomide', 'patient', 'symptoms']",[]
40632098,Acute accidental methotrexate poisoning: Fatal consequences - An Indian experience.,"Methotrexate (MTX) is a versatile drug used in various fields, including oncology and rheumatology, acting by inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis and cellular replication. While low-dose MTX is a first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, overdose or incorrect dosing can lead to severe toxicity. We present three cases of accidental MTX poisoning, highlighting the diverse clinical manifestations and challenges in management. Patients presented with fever, weakness, mucocutaneous lesions, and pancytopenia, necessitating intensive care and supportive treatment. These cases underscore the importance of proper dosing, patient education, and pharmacist vigilance to prevent medication errors. Heightened awareness among clinicians is crucial to promptly recognize and manage MTX toxicity, ensuring the safe and effective use of this valuable therapeutic agent.

40627640,Determining genotype and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella Typhi in environmental samples by amplicon sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Estimates of the burden of typhoid fever due to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) rely on data from clinical surveillance, which is rarely done in low income settings and is also limited by the poor sensitivity of the assays used and the reliance on health seeking by patients. Environmental surveillance for S. Typhi shed by symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in wastewater offers a sensitive surveillance tool that could help to inform burden estimates. Sequencing S. Typhi direct from wastewater concentrates has the potential to identify circulating genotypes and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, supporting public health interventions such as vaccination and antimicrobial usage. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We designed a multiplex targeted amplicon sequencing protocol for genotyping and determining AMR in S. Typhi from wastewater samples, targeting SNPs that identify genotypes of interest and both chromosomal and plasmid-borne AMR. PCR products were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION, and genotypes and AMR identified using the GenoTyphi program. We tested this approach on samples from south India from both hospital outflow and wastewater collected from the community. All samples tested were suspected to be positive for S. Typhi following quantitative PCR for ttr, tviB, and staG gene targets. Out of 110 samples tested we were able to determine a genotype and/or AMR for 8. All samples that gave a genotype call suggested a genotype consistent with those found in clinical cases in India during the same time period and produced consensus sequences that clustered with S. Typhi when included in a phylogenetic tree. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide proof of concept data for amplicon sequencing of S. Typhi in wastewater which with further optimisation could be used to complement clinical surveillance data or provide data on S. Typhi presence in the absence of clinical surveillance. This information can inform public health interventions, and the concept could be applied to other pathogens of interest for genotyping from environmental surveillance samples.",2025 Jul,"['background', 'estimates', 'burden', 'typhoid fever', 'salmonella enterica serovar typhi', 's. typhi', 'data', 'clinical surveillance', 'low income settings', 'poor sensitivity', 'assays', 'health seeking', 'patients', 'environmental', 'surveillance', 's. typhi', 'symptomatic', 'asymptomatic', 'individuals', 'wastewater', 'sensitive', 'surveillance tool', 'burden', 'estimates', 'sequencing', 's. typhi', 'wastewater', 'potential', 'circulating', 'genotypes', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'amr', 'public health', 'vaccination', 'antimicrobial', 'usage', 'principal findings', 'multiplex', 'genotyping', 'amr', 's. typhi', 'wastewater samples', 'targeting', 'snps', 'genotypes', 'chromosomal', 'plasmid-borne', 'amr', 'pcr products', 'sequenced', 'oxford nanopore technologies', 'ont', 'genotypes', 'amr', 'identified', 'genotyphi program', 'samples', 'south india', 'hospital outflow', 'wastewater', 'collected', 'community', 'samples', 'tested', 'suspected', 'positive', 's. typhi', 'quantitative pcr', 'ttr', 'tvib', 'stag', 'gene targets', 'samples', 'genotype', 'amr', 'samples', 'genotype', 'genotype', 'consistent with', 'clinical cases', 'india', 'time', 'consensus sequences', 'clustered', 's. typhi', 'phylogenetic tree', 'study', 'concept', 'data', 'amplicon sequencing', 's. typhi', 'wastewater', 'optimisation', 'clinical', 'data', 'data', 's. typhi', 'presence', 'absence', 'clinical surveillance', 'information', 'public health', 'interventions', 'concept', 'pathogens', 'genotyping', 'environmental surveillance samples']",['India']
40625744,GMMA-based vaccine candidates against invasive nontyphoidal salmonellosis elicit bactericidal antibodies against a panel of epidemiologically relevant Salmonellae.,"Systemic disease caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) represents a major cause of death and morbidity, especially in young children in sub-Saharan Africa. No licensed vaccine is yet available, and an increase in antimicrobial resistance makes the development of a vaccine a global health priority. We are developing a bivalent formulation of Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA)-based vaccine (iNTS-GMMA) and a trivalent formulation (iNTS-TCV) in which iNTS-GMMA is combined with the WHO-prequalified TYPHIBEV (Biological E, India) vaccine to prevent typhoid fever in addition to invasive NTS (iNTS) disease. Here, we measured the ability of antibodies induced by iNTS-GMMA and iNTS-TCV formulations in mice and rabbits to kill a broad panel of Salmonella in vitro in a complement-mediated fashion. These organisms include those causing invasive disease in Africa and Southeast Asia, global representatives causing gastroenteritis and other S. enterica serovars in addition to S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis.

He had non-resolving suppurative otitis media and two episodes of pneumonia in the past 2 years. During admission, clinical and radiological evaluations revealed bilateral lung consolidation with synpneumonic effusion. Examination also revealed the absence of bilateral tonsils. Blood and pleural fluid cultures were sterile. The child developed a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) associated with haemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytic syndrome (HLH) during the hospital stay. Given his history of recurrent infections and absent tonsils, primary immunodeficiency disorder was suspected. Immunological work-up showed reduced levels of IgG and IgM in serum. Exome sequencing identified a mutation in the SH2D1A gene confirming a diagnosis of X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (Duncan syndrome).

40622975,Chikungunya masquerading as dengue infection in Sri Lanka uncovered by metagenomics.,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue is a significant threat to human health in South and Southeast Asia where patients are treated without diagnostic confirmation during outbreaks. This approach, though cost-effective may miss important infections especially those caused by other arboviruses (e.g., Zika, Chikungunya and West Nile virus). This study aimed to diagnose missed infections mimicking dengue by using metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) was extracted and subjected to mNGS from acute infection plasma of 60 patients from a prospective cohort study in Sri Lanka in which patients with clinically suspected dengue fever were recruited but were later confirmed as dengue-negative by NS1 antigen testing and by dengue-specific reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. mNGS data revealed missed chikungunya and dengue infections in five patients each, and a possible bacterial infection by Klebsiella pneumoniae in another patient. It was not possible to differentiate chikungunya infections from dengue infections based on clinical features or routine non-diagnostic laboratory tests conducted in early infection (e.g., full blood count, C-reactive protein level). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the chikungunya sequences from this study were closely related to those sequenced from Maldives, Malaysia, India and Singapore between 2015-2019. CONCLUSIONS: Chikungunya infection may masquerade as dengue especially in low- and middle-income countries where dengue is treated based on clinical suspicion only - without confirmatory testing. As both infections are likely prevalent worldwide, but the complications and natural history of chikungunya and dengue infections are quite different, the addition of cheap and accessible diagnostics for both infections should be pursued in endemic countries.",2025,"['dengue', 'threat', 'human', 'health', 'south', 'southeast asia', 'patients', 'treated', 'diagnostic', 'outbreaks', 'cost-effective', 'infections', 'arboviruses', 'zika', 'chikungunya', 'west nile virus', 'study', 'diagnose', 'infections', 'mimicking', 'dengue', 'metagenomic', 'next generation sequencing', 'mngs', 'principal findings', 'nucleic acid', 'dna', 'rna', 'mngs', 'acute infection', 'plasma', 'patients', 'prospective cohort study', 'sri lanka', 'patients', 'clinically suspected', 'dengue fever', 'dengue-negative', 'ns1 antigen testing', 'dengue-specific', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'rt-pcr', 'mngs', 'data', 'chikungunya', 'dengue infections', 'patients', 'bacterial infection', 'klebsiella pneumoniae', 'patient', 'differentiate', 'chikungunya', 'infections', 'dengue infections', 'clinical features', 'routine', 'non-diagnostic laboratory tests', 'early infection', 'full blood count', 'c-reactive protein level', 'phylogenetic analysis', 'chikungunya', 'sequences', 'study', 'sequenced', 'maldives', 'malaysia', 'india', 'singapore', 'chikungunya infection', 'masquerade', 'dengue', 'low-', 'middle-income', 'countries', 'dengue', 'treated', 'clinical suspicion', 'without', 'confirmatory testing', 'infections', 'complications', 'natural history', 'chikungunya', 'dengue infections', 'cheap', 'diagnostics', 'infections', 'endemic countries']","['India', 'Sri Lanka', 'Maldives', 'Malaysia', 'Singapore']"
40621243,Mumps Encephalitis in a Measles Rubella (MR)-Vaccinated Child: A Rare but Preventable Complication.,"Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by the mumps virus, mainly affecting the salivary glands. It can cause serious complications, including mumps encephalitis. Despite widespread immunization practices, mumps outbreaks persist among both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, raising issues of concern regarding herd immunity. Mumps encephalitis, although rare, can produce serious complications warranting prompt diagnosis and management. Here, in this case report, we present a five-year-old girl who presented with fever, bilateral parotid swelling, and a single episode of abnormal movement in the form of dystonia associated with fixed gaze and disorientation. The patient had received two doses of the measles rubella (MR) vaccine as per India's universal immunization program (UIP). Laboratory investigations showed high amylase levels, positive serum mumps IgM, and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis; all indicative of mumps encephalitis. Brain imaging was normal, excluding other neurological causes. Initial empirical antibiotics and acyclovir were discontinued following the diagnosis of mumps encephalitis. The patient showed improvement within 48 hours of supportive treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering mumps encephalitis in pediatric patients with mumps showing neurological symptoms. It also demonstrates the public health impact of omitting the mumps vaccine from India's UIP and the major role of the mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccination in preventing such complications.",2025 Jun,"['mumps', 'vaccine-preventable disease', 'mumps virus', 'affecting', 'salivary glands', 'complications', 'mumps encephalitis', 'immunization practices', 'mumps outbreaks', 'vaccinated', 'unvaccinated populations', 'issues', 'herd immunity', 'mumps encephalitis', 'rare', 'complications', 'diagnosis', 'management', 'case report', 'girl', 'fever', 'bilateral', 'parotid swelling', 'episode', 'abnormal', 'movement', 'dystonia', 'associated with', 'fixed gaze', 'disorientation', 'patient', 'doses', 'measles rubella (mr) vaccine', ""india's"", 'immunization program', 'uip', 'laboratory investigations', 'amylase', 'positive', 'igm', 'cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis', 'mumps encephalitis', 'brain imaging', 'neurological causes', 'empirical', 'antibiotics', 'acyclovir', 'discontinued', 'diagnosis', 'mumps encephalitis', 'patient', 'improvement', 'supportive treatment', 'mumps encephalitis', 'pediatric', 'patients', 'mumps', 'neurological symptoms', 'public health', 'impact', 'mumps vaccine', ""india's"", 'uip', 'mumps', 'measles', 'rubella', 'mmr', 'vaccination', 'preventing', 'complications']",['India']

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study over 11 years (2014-2024) in the pediatric emergency and intensive care units of a quaternary hospital in North India. Children aged one month to 12 years diagnosed with ANEC were enrolled. Data on demographics, clinical features, laboratory and neuroimaging findings, etiology, management, and outcomes were collected. The ANEC Severity Score (ANE-SS) was calculated. RESULTS: Thirty-two children were included (median age, 4 [interquartile range, 1-7] years; 53.1% male). Common clinical features included altered state of consciousness (96.9%), fever (93.7%), seizures (78.1%), and signs of raised intracranial pressure (46.9%). Organ dysfunctions included encephalopathy (100%), transaminitis (56.2%), and thrombocytopenia (46.9%). Neuroimaging revealed bilateral thalamic involvement in all cases. Etiology was identified in 37.5%, most commonly dengue virus (21.9%), followed by H1N1 (6.2%). Intensive care interventions included mechanical ventilation (56.2%) and vasoactive drugs (31.2%). Immunomodulatory therapy included methylprednisolone (78.1%), intravenous immunoglobulin (25%), and tocilizumab (15.6%). Survival rate was 78.1%. At discharge, the median Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score was 3 (3-4), indicating moderate to severe disability. High-risk ANE-SS was significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: ANEC remains a severe pediatric encephalopathy with high neuromorbidity. Dengue virus was the most common trigger in this cohort.

40615133,Dengue cerebellitis in middle childhood from South India.,"We had a girl in middle childhood, who presented with fever of 7 days duration, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. The child was conscious with signs of shock. With the provisional diagnosis of dengue fever, enteric fever or scrub typhus, the child was given all supportive management. Lab investigations covering the fever panel were sent. Within 24 hours of admission, the child developed horizontal nystagmus, diplopia and intermittent dizziness. Fundus examination showed papilloedema. MRI brain showed hyperintensity of the cerebellum in T2 sections suggestive of cerebellitis. Dengue IgM antibody was positive with transaminitis and hyperferritinaemia. Child was given anti-oedema measures with supportive care.

40612792,Exploring the bioactive-based therapeutic and culinary potential of Madhuca longifolia flower and delineating the research gaps in terms of scientific validation.,"The flower of Madhuca longifolia (family Sapotaceae) has a long history of traditional use in treating fever, inflammation, rheumatism, ulcers, impotence, skin ailments and heart diseases across Southeast Asia. In India, the flower is commonly consumed as a regular food item and is also used as a tonic, appetizer, galactagogue and carminative agent, particularly among rural populations residing near plantations. There are ethnopharmacological claims about several therapeutic properties and antidiabetic activities of the flower, but no scientific evidence is available on this aspect. This review aims to explore the traditional, nutraceutical and pharmacological properties of M. longifolia flowers while identifying the research gaps for establishing its therapeutic use. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, Scopus, and Web of Science from 2000 to 2025. Only research and review articles were considered for analysis. Our findings present that the major bioactive compounds identified in the flower include rutin, quercetin, Mi-saponin A & B, madhucoside A & B, gallic acid and ascorbic acid. In vitro studies indicate that it has strong antioxidant activity, while in-vivo studies on animal models document hepatoprotective, anti-dyslipidemic and antidepressant properties, but these studies are miniscule. Till date no clinical trials have been conducted on the therapeutic efficacy of the flower. Although the flower is naturally rich in several bioactive compounds, its potential therapeutic properties have not been scientifically validated. Focused research is needed to extract and quantify all the key bioactives of the flower. Additionally, studies involving human participants to assess the flower's therapeutic properties are needed to bridge the gap between traditional use and modern pharmacology.",2025 Aug,"['flower', 'madhuca longifolia', 'family sapotaceae', 'long history', 'treating', 'fever', 'inflammation', 'rheumatism', 'ulcers', 'impotence', 'skin ailments', 'heart diseases', 'southeast asia', 'india', 'flower', 'regular food item', 'tonic', 'appetizer', 'galactagogue', 'carminative agent', 'rural populations', 'near', 'plantations', 'ethnopharmacological claims', 'therapeutic', 'antidiabetic activities', 'flower', 'scientific evidence', 'aspect', 'review', 'traditional', 'nutraceutical', 'pharmacological', 'm. longifolia', 'flowers', 'research', 'therapeutic', 'comprehensive', 'literature', 'search', 'google scholar', 'pubmed', 'sciencedirect', 'researchgate', 'scopus', 'web of science', 'research', 'review', 'articles', 'analysis', 'findings', 'bioactive compounds', 'identified', 'flower', 'rutin', 'quercetin', 'mi-saponin a & b', 'madhucoside a & b', 'gallic acid', 'ascorbic acid', 'in vitro', 'studies', 'antioxidant activity', 'in-vivo', 'studies', 'animal models', 'hepatoprotective', 'anti-dyslipidemic', 'antidepressant', 'properties', 'studies', 'miniscule', 'clinical trials', 'therapeutic', 'efficacy', 'flower', 'flower', 'bioactive compounds', 'therapeutic', 'scientifically validated', 'focused research', 'extract', 'quantify', 'bioactives', 'flower', 'studies', 'human', 'participants', ""flower's"", 'therapeutic', 'gap', 'modern pharmacology']",['India']
40612724,"Phenotypic, genotypic characterization and antimicrobial resistance profiling of uropathogenic Escherichia coli in a tertiary care hospital, Puducherry, India.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) (UPEC) accounts for 70-95% of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) and a significant proportion of nosocomial UTIs. This study aimed to characterize the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of E. coli isolates from symptomatic UTI patients and evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based observational study was conducted at Aarupadai Veedu Medical College and Hospital, Puducherry, India, from August 2022 to April 2024. A total of 106 UPEC isolates were obtained from symptomatic UTI patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed using the Kirby-Bauer method, and virulence genes (hlyA, fimH, papC) were detected using PCR. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 49.7 years, with a female predominance (69.8%). Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity (29.2%). Fever (60.4%) and dysuria (38.7%) were the most common symptoms. AST showed high susceptibility (>90%) to amikacin, nitrofurantoin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam, while >60% resistance was observed to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Phenotypically, 30.2% of the isolates produced mannose-resistant hemagglutinins, and 17.9% produced hemolysin. ESBL production was found in 46.3%. Biofilm production was moderate in 65.1%, weak in 30.2% and strong in 4.7% and significantly correlated with multidrug resistance (p<0.05). Genotypically, 80.2% had fimH, 51.9% had papC and 20.8% had hlyA. papC was associated with reduced cefotaxime susceptibility (p<0.05).

40611538,Patterns of Care and Survival of Wilms Tumor in Children in India: A Retrospective Multicentric INPHOG Study.,"Renal cancers are rare in children, accounting 6-7% of childhood tumors. In India, there is paucity of data on renal tumors including Wilms tumor (WT). AIMS: To describe the patterns of care of children with WT; 1, 3, and 5 year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Retrospective analysis (InPOG-WT-18-02) of data of children (<18 years) with WT from 17 pediatric-oncology centers between January 2010 and June 2021. RESULTS: A total of 404 children (male:female, 1.4:1) with WT were included in the study. The majority (74%) were less than 4 years of age (median age 27 months). The most common presentation was abdominal distension/incidental mass (91%). Other presentations (9%) included fever, weight loss, hematuria, hypertension, and others. Unilateral tumors were seen in 91.6%, bilateral tumors in 7.4%. Metastatic disease was seen in 63 (15.6%) children, common sites being lung (82.5%), liver (17.5%), and bone (6.4%). The International Society of Pediatric Oncology protocol was used in 58% of patients. Twelve children (3%) abandoned the treatment. For the remaining 392 cases, follow-up ranged from 1 to 144 months. Relapse/progression was seen in 44 children (10.9%). Mortality was 6.7%. Relapse with discontinuation of treatment was the most common cause of death (3.7%), followed by death from progression on treatment (1.3%). Treatment-related mortality was 1.7%. The 1, 3, and 5 year OS was 95.3, 92.4, and 91.5%, respectively. The 1, 3, and 5 year EFS was 91.8, 87.2, and 85.9%, respectively.

40601204,Climate Change and the Impact on Ocular Infectious Diseases: A Narrative Review.,"Climate change and global warming significantly affect the incidence and distribution of infectious ocular diseases. This narrative review explores how climate-related factors-including extreme weather events, precipitation, temperature fluctuations, humidity, wind patterns, ultraviolet radiation, and air pollution-can directly and indirectly influence the burden of ocular infections. By synthesizing evidence from the published literature, we examine how these environmental variables impact disease mechanisms such as pathogen survival, transmission dynamics, and host susceptibility. Increased precipitation has been associated with a higher incidence and recurrence of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), likely due to the enhanced spread of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts through contaminated water and soil. Rainfall also creates breeding habitats for mosquitoes, facilitating the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever and Rift Valley fever. Rising temperatures and humidity have been linked to increased rates of fungal infections, particularly fungal keratitis in tropical regions. Wind has been implicated in the airborne dispersal of pathogens, including fungal spores, T. gondii oocysts, and insect-derived particles such as moth setae, potentially contributing to OT and seasonal hyperacute panuveitis. Air pollution further exacerbates dry eye disease, which influences the vulnerability to microbial keratitis. These climate-related shifts disproportionately affect vulnerable populations-particularly those living in rural, low-income, and tropical areas. This review highlights the urgent need for further research into climate-sensitive mechanisms of ocular infections and the development of targeted adaptation strategies to mitigate their impact on global eye health.",2025 Aug,"['climate change', 'global warming', 'incidence', 'distribution', 'infectious ocular diseases', 'narrative review', 'climate-related factors-including', 'weather', 'events', 'precipitation', 'temperature', 'fluctuations', 'humidity', 'wind', 'patterns', 'ultraviolet radiation', 'air', 'influence', 'burden', 'ocular infections', 'evidence', 'published literature', 'environmental', 'impact', 'disease', 'mechanisms', 'pathogen', 'survival', 'transmission', 'dynamics', 'host', 'susceptibility', 'increased', 'precipitation', 'associated with', 'higher', 'incidence', 'recurrence', 'ocular toxoplasmosis', 'enhanced', 'spread', 'toxoplasma gondii', 'oocysts', 'contaminated water', 'soil', 'rainfall', 'breeding', 'habitats', 'mosquitoes', 'transmission', 'vector-borne diseases', 'dengue fever', 'rift valley fever', 'rising', 'temperatures', 'humidity', 'increased', 'rates', 'fungal infections', 'fungal keratitis', 'tropical regions', 'wind', 'airborne', 'dispersal', 'pathogens', 'fungal spores', 't. gondii', 'oocysts', 'insect-derived particles', 'moth', 'setae', 'seasonal', 'hyperacute panuveitis', 'air pollution', 'dry eye disease', 'influences', 'vulnerability', 'microbial keratitis', 'climate-related shifts', 'vulnerable', 'populations-particularly', 'living', 'rural', 'low-income', 'tropical areas', 'review', 'research', 'climate-sensitive', 'mechanisms', 'ocular infections', 'development', 'targeted', 'adaptation', 'mitigate', 'impact', 'global eye health']",[]

Routine investigations revealed pancytopenia and a positive dengue NS1 antigen test, confirming a diagnosis of dengue fever. Neurological examination revealed abnormalities, such as nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, and altered mental status, which raised the initial suspicion of an alternative diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral thalamic hyperintensities and meningeal enhancement, while the positive dengue status revealed a rare manifestation of dengue meningoencephalitis. However, owing to the patient's history of chronic alcoholism, WE could not be completely ruled out. The diagnostic challenge in distinguishing between WE and dengue-associated neurological complications is highlighted by the overlapping symptoms in this case.

40597945,Assessing myelofibrosis burden on QoL and productivity from healthcare personnel and patient perspectives in India.,"BACKGROUND: Myelofibrosis (MF), leads to variety of symptoms, significantly impacting patients' quality of life (QoL) and work productivity. Limited data exists on MF in India. This survey conducted among Indian physicians and their patients with MF evaluated patient journey, understand perceptions around symptom burden, its impact on QoL, and management. METHODS: This cross-sectional and multicentric survey between October to November 2021 across 17 cities was conducted using a structured questionnaire based on certain identified themes (symptom burden, QoL parameters, treatment goals and patient communication) during one-on-one telephonic interview. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Fifty physicians and 154 patients (primary MF: 51, post-PV: 78, post-ET: 25) participated. Diagnostic delay of 10 months from symptom onset was noted. 151 (98%) patients reported reduced QoL and loss of work productivity. Majority of the patients (56%) reported a negative impact on work productivity, with 76% confirming that MF hindered their work-related daily activities and 42% having reduced work hours. Key symptoms included abdominal pain (patients: 81%, physicians: 70%), fatigue (77% vs. 73%), and fever (54% vs. 48%). Patient-physician perception discrepancies on QoL factors were notable, particularly bone pain (12% vs. 64%), sleep difficulties (8% vs. 70%), sexual problems (2% vs. 78%), depression (4% vs. 63%), and inactivity (4% vs. 66%). CONCLUSION: The study results highlight the negative impact of MF on work productivity by hampering their work-related daily activities and reducing the work hours.

Amphotericin B in a dose of 4 mg/kg/day was started based on the antifungal sensitivity test.",2025 Mar-Apr,"['infective endocarditis', 'viral', 'bacterial', 'fungal', 'pathogens', 'morbidity', 'mortality', 'fungal endocarditis', 'rare', 'associated with', 'severe', 'complications', 'poor prognosis', 'combined medical', 'surgical treatment', 'candida albicans', 'fungal agent', 'severe', 'endocarditis', 'candida parapsilosis', 'non-albicans', 'causative species', 'patient', 'liver transplant', 'paediatric', 'diagnosis', 'right heart failure', 'coronary artery bypass graft', 'aortic valve replacement', 'outpatient clinic', 'complaints', 'fever', 'weakness', 'nausea', 'vomiting', 'physical examination', 'pallor', 'dyspnoea', 'tachycardia', 'fever', 'grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur', 'detected', 'auscultation', 'amphotericin b', 'dose', 'antifungal']",[]
40587085,Dengue Fever Complicated by Acute Angle-closure Glaucoma and Endophthalmitis.,"Dengue fever presents with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from fever, rash, myalgia to myocarditis, encephalitis, etc. However, severe ocular involvement in dengue is less frequent, but if it occurs it can have devastating and long-lasting effects such as permanent vision loss. We present the case of a 35-year-old male with dengue fever complicated by acute, painful vision loss in the right eye and was diagnosed with acute congestive glaucoma leading to panophthalmitis. Timely diagnosis and prompt intervention in the form of enucleation of the affected eye saved his vision in the unaffected left eye.",2025 Jun 30,"['dengue fever', 'clinical manifestations', 'fever', 'rash', 'myalgia', 'myocarditis', 'encephalitis', 'ocular', 'involvement', 'dengue', 'frequent', 'devastating', 'effects', 'permanent vision loss', 'case', 'male', 'dengue fever', 'complicated', 'acute', 'painful', 'right eye', 'diagnosed', 'acute congestive glaucoma', 'panophthalmitis', 'timely', 'diagnosis', 'intervention', 'enucleation', 'affected', 'eye saved', 'vision', 'left eye']",[]
40587017,Does suction in Mini PCNL mitigate rise in intrarenal pressure? A prospective randomised study.,"The rise in intra-renal pressure during Mini PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotripsy) potentially leads to pyelovenous backflow and infectious complications. This prospective randomized study compares intra-renal pressure (IRP) in patients undergoing Mini PCNL (mPCNL) procedure with and without suction for renal stones. Suction mPCNL is expected to lower IRP by continuously aspirating irrigation fluid and stone fragments, thereby enhancing procedural safety. A total of 100 patients with kidney stones measuring 1-4 cm were randomized into two groups: Mini PCNL with suction (n = 50) and Mini PCNL without suction (n = 50). IRP was measured using a pressure transducer connected to a ureteral catheter. Key outcome measures included intra-renal pressure, stone-free rate, operative time, and complication rates. The suction mPCNL group demonstrated a significantly lower IRP (16.92 +/- 2.93 mmHg) compared to the non-suction group (19.48 +/- 4.77 mmHg, p = 0.002). The suction group also experienced shorter mean operative times (35.98 +/- 14.10 min vs. 47.12 +/- 15.36 min, p = 0.001) and lithotripsy times (19.50 +/- 11.70 min vs. 26.24 +/- 10.49 min, p = 0.003). The stone-free rate was higher in the suction group though this difference was not statistically significant. Likewise, the complication rates, including postoperative infection rates (fever and urosepsis) showed a downward trend in the suction group, however the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Suction mPCNL effectively reduces IRP, shortens operative time, maintains a comparable stone-free rate, making it a safer and more efficient alternative to traditional mPCNL. This study highlights the potential advantages of integrating suction mechanisms to control IRP and improve patient outcomes in PCNL procedures.",2025 Jun 30,"['intra-renal pressure', 'mini pcnl', 'percutaneous nephrolithotripsy', 'pyelovenous backflow', 'infectious complications', 'randomized study', 'intra-renal pressure', 'irp', 'patients', 'mini pcnl', 'mpcnl', 'suction', 'renal stones', 'suction', 'mpcnl', 'irp', 'irrigation', 'fluid', 'stone', 'fragments', 'procedural safety', 'patients', 'kidney stones', 'measuring', 'randomized', 'groups', 'mini', 'pcnl', 'suction', 'mini', 'pcnl', 'suction', 'irp', 'pressure transducer', 'ureteral catheter', 'intra-renal pressure', 'stone-free rate', 'operative time', 'complication', 'rates', 'suction', 'mpcnl', 'group', 'irp', 'non-suction', 'group', 'suction group', 'shorter', 'operative times', 'lithotripsy', 'stone-free rate', 'suction', 'group', 'statistically significant', 'complication', 'rates', 'postoperative', 'rates', 'fever', 'urosepsis', 'suction', 'group', 'difference', 'statistically significant', 'suction', 'mpcnl', 'reduces', 'irp', 'operative time', 'stone-free rate', 'efficient', 'alternative', 'mpcnl', 'study', 'suction', 'mechanisms', 'control', 'irp', 'improve', 'patient', 'pcnl', 'procedures']",[]
