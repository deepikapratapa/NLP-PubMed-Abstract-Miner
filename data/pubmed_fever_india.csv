40747162,Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Renal Abscess Unmasks Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection in an Adolescent: A Case Report.,"Renal abscesses are rare in children. This report presents a case where a renal abscess due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the initial indication of immunocompromised status in an adolescent boy. A 17-year-old male patient presented with a month-long history of fever, fatigue, and significant weight loss, along with dull aches and swelling in the left flank. There was no history of urinary symptoms, vomiting, or high-risk behaviors. His mother had died from sepsis while on antiretroviral therapy (ART), and his father from coronary artery disease. The patient had not been previously tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Examination revealed a tender fullness in the left lumbar region. Ultrasound showed a collection in the left kidney. Blood tests indicated anemia and elevated inflammatory markers. The patient tested positive for HIV antibodies. Empirical antibiotics were started. Ultrasound-guided aspiration grew MRSA, prompting a switch to vancomycin. A percutaneous catheter was inserted due to abscess recurrence. The patient received intravenous vancomycin followed by oral linezolid and started antiretroviral therapy. Repeat imaging at six weeks showed resolution of the abscess. Renal abscesses in children can be life-threatening and often result from urinary tract infections or hematogenous spread. This patient's abscess likely resulted from hematogenous spread due to immunocompromised status. Effective management, including prompt percutaneous drainage and targeted antibiotics, combined with ART, led to abscess resolution and a favorable outcome. This case underscores the importance of considering immunodeficiency in pediatric patients with unusual infections like renal abscesses and highlights the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach and aggressive management for complex infections in immunocompromised children.",2025 Jul
40746790,Diverse Manifestations of Central Nervous System Tuberculosis: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Presentations and Laboratory Investigations in a Cohort Study.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate and characterize the diverse MRI findings in central nervous system (CNS) tuberculosis (TB) and the role of other laboratory investigations to aid in early detection and appropriate management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective, cross-sectional study analyzed clinical and imaging data from 43 patients with confirmed CNS TB. The diagnosis was confirmed through cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, biopsy, or clinical and radiological improvement post-antitubercular therapy (ATT). MRI findings were categorized into meningeal and parenchymal forms, with further subtyping based on lesion characteristics. Chi-square statistics were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) to correlate CNS TB with clinical parameters.  Results: The mean age of the 43 patients was 33 years, and 58% were male. The most common clinical symptoms were headache (86%) and fever (79%). MRI findings revealed meningeal TB (leptomeningitis and pachymeningitis) and parenchymal TB (tuberculomas, tubercular abscesses, cerebritis, rhombencephalitis, and encephalopathy). Frequent observations included ring-enhancing lesions and perilesional edema. Parenchymal tuberculomas showed varying stages. Advanced imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy and perfusion imaging were useful in differentiating tuberculomas from neoplastic and infectious differentials. CONCLUSION: CNS TB presents with diverse MRI patterns, including both typical and atypical manifestations. Accurate radiological assessment, combined with clinical correlation, is essential for early diagnosis and management. Prompt initiation of ATT is critical in preventing long-term neurological complications. Future research should focus on refining imaging biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy.",2025 Jun
40742524,Anti-chikungunya Activity of a Cinnamic Acid Derivative: An In Vitro and In Silico Study.,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus that causes debilitating joint pain and fever with limited treatment options. Cinnamic acid, known for its broad-spectrum biological activities, and its derivatives were evaluated for their potential antiviral effects against CHIKV. In vitro experiments assessed the cytotoxicity of cinnamic acid and its derivatives and their efficacy in inhibiting CHIKV under different treatment settings. Additionally, molecular docking of the effective compounds with CHIKV proteins was performed to determine the probable targets. The results indicated that the derivative CATD-3, a 3,6-(substituted phenyl)-(1,2,4) triazolo [3,4-b][1,3,4] thiadiazole compound, showed antiviral activity under post-infection treatment conditions in Vero CCL-81 cells. The dose-dependent studies revealed that the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 11.49 microM and the selectivity index of CATD-3 was 13.39. The antiviral activity of CATD-3 was also observed in HeLa cells. In-silico studies revealed that the CATD-3 binds multiple non-structural proteins (nsP) i.e., nsP1, nsP2, and nsP4 of the virus with good binding energies and forming strong interactions with conserved residues on nsP1 methyl transferase (Val 129, Tyr 130, Ala 131) and nsP2 helicase (Met 91, Met 289, and Thr 261) and critical residues of the nsP4 RdRp (Arg331 and Asp 350). The combined in vitro and in silico studies underscores the therapeutic potential of cinnamic acid derivative, CATD-3, as a promising antiviral candidate against CHIKV.",2025 Jul 31
40742003,Paradoxical Hemoglobin Drop Post-Transfusion: Hyperhemolysis in Delta-Beta Thalassemia with Macrophage Activation Syndrome.,"Hyperhaemolysis syndrome (HHS) is a rare, severe complication of transfusion characterised by a paradoxical drop in haemoglobin (Hb) levels post-transfusion, often below pre-transfusion values. Most reported cases are in patients with sickle cell disease and it has been rarely reported in other haemoglobinopathies. We report a case of HHS in a newly diagnosed delta-beta thalassaemia patient, manifesting as macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), successfully managed with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), corticosteroids, rituximab, and erythropoietin. A 19-year-old female presented with fever, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly three weeks after a blood transfusion. Investigations revealed microcytic anaemia, elevated LDH and indirect bilirubin, and HPLC findings suggestive of delta-beta thalassaemia. She developed haemolysis and a paradoxical Hb drop after subsequent transfusions, along with reticulocytopenia. Alloimmunisation was initially absent but anti-E and anti-K antibodies were subsequently detected. Despite antigen-matched transfusions, haemolysis persisted, raising suspicion for HHS. She was managed with IVIG, methylprednisolone, erythropoietin, and rituximab, resulting in initial improvement in haemoglobin levels, which subsequently declined again. She then developed fever and leukocytosis without evidence of infection, and a high HScore raised suspicion for macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Dexamethasone was initiated, leading to defervescence, normalisation of the reticulocyte count, and a significant rise in haemoglobin. She was discharged in stable condition and remained well at 6-month follow-up. This case highlights hyperhaemolysis syndrome (HHS) as a potential complication in patients with haemoglobinopathies. Although its exact pathogenesis remains unclear, macrophage activation appears to play an important role. Early recognition and timely initiation of appropriate immunotherapy can lead to favourable outcomes.",2025 Jul 31
40741554,Clinico-Epidemiological Profile of Dengue in Children of Age Group 0-14 Years Admitted in a Tertiary Care Hospital.,"Background Dengue has emerged as the most common arboviral infection in India and worldwide. Dengue presents with a varied clinical spectrum in different age groups. The changing epidemiology and presentation are a challenge for early diagnosis and management. This prospective observational study aimed to determine the epidemiological profile of hospitalized dengue-positive children aged 0-14 years and correlate their clinical and hematological profiles. Methodology One hundred and five children with laboratory-confirmed dengue were enrolled in this study over a six-month study period. They were categorized into severe and non-severe dengue according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Detailed clinical examination and laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, liver enzymes, coagulation profile, and imaging (chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound), were performed. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis. Results Out of the total 105 cases, 90 children (85.7%) had non-severe dengue and only 15 (14.3%) had severe dengue. The mean age of children was 92.02 months, with a male predominance (72, 68.6%). The most commonly identified symptoms were fever (105, 100%), vomiting (47, 44.76%), and abdominal pain (46, 43.81%). It was found that although thrombocytopenia was seen in 79 children (75.2%), it was not significantly associated with the severity of the disease (P = 0.2364). The study found a high recovery rate (101, 96.3%) with a mortality of 3 patients (2.8%) in severe cases. Elevated serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels (P = 0.0025), pleural effusion on chest X-ray (P = 0.000452), abdominal pain (P = 0.0041), and a positive tourniquet test (P < 0.0001) were found to be significantly associated with severe dengue. Non-structural protein 1 (NS1) antigen and immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were both found to be positive more frequently in severe cases compared to non-severe cases (P = 0.0361). Conclusions This study observed a high rate of recovery and low mortality, owing to the timely management. A possible shift in the seasonal distribution of dengue was observed, with many cases occurring in the winter season. While thrombocytopenia was prevalent, it was not found to be significantly associated with disease severity or bleeding. On the other hand, elevated liver enzymes, pleural effusion, abdominal pain, and a positive tourniquet test were found to be more strongly associated with severe dengue. They may serve as valuable early clinical indicators for the severity of the disease.",2025 Jun
40739540,Study of rheumatoid arthritis in older patients: a cross-sectional study.,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in older adults is a chronic inflammatory condition causing severe disability and impacting patients' physical, psychological, and social health. It lowers productivity in society and puts pressure on healthcare systems. This study aims to explore the different aspects of RA and investigate the diagnostic potential of serum marker 14-3-3eta. METHOD: This Cross-sectional study recruited 205 arthritis patients (63 RA and 142 OA) over sixty years old. The participants underwent a thorough clinical evaluation according to the established design. Anti-CCP and serum 14-3-3eta levels were measured. Simple logistic regression was performed to identify significant predictors of RA. ROC curve determined optimal cut-off value for 14-3-3eta. RESULTS: This study reported an average age of 63.67 years with a high female-to-male ratio of 4:1 in the RA cohort, while in the OA cohort, the mean age was 65.5 years with a low female-to-male ratio of 2:1 overall. Symptomatically, RA patients exhibited earlier onset, pronounced early morning stiffness, fever, weight loss, myalgia, and fatigue, all with highly significant p-values (< 0.001). Comorbidities showed higher incidences of anemia, ILD, and osteoporosis in RA patients. Impaired ADL and IADL were noted in 17.5% and 73.2%, respectively. Impaired HMSE and GDS were found in 36.5% and 74.6%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis identified key predictors distinguishing RA from OA, including EMS (OR: 1.09, p < 0.001), fever (OR: 6.68, p < 0.001), weight loss (OR: 6.35, p < 0.001), myalgia (OR: 5.07, p < 0.001), osteoporosis (OR: 2.21, p = 0.013), ACCP levels (OR: 1.28, p < 0.001), and the novel marker 14-3-3eta (OR: 2.87, p = 0.047). Using both ACCP and14-3-3eta markers, 88.88% of RA patients were positive for at least one marker, enhancing its diagnostic coverage. Elderly onset RA (EORA) patients had a significantly higher age and shorter disease duration compared to those with young onset RA (YORA). The female-to-male ratio in the YORA and EORA group were 6.97:1 and 1.66:1 respectively. PMR-like symptoms were more prevalent in the EORA group (31.25% vs.14.9%). Hypothyroidism was more frequent in the EORA group (31% vs. 17%). Sulfasalazine was more commonly prescribed in both EORA (100%) and YORA (89%) groups. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to a better understanding of distinguishing RA from OA. It also highlights the differences between young and elderly onset RA, and supports the diagnostic potential of the serum marker 14-3-3eta.",2025 Jul 30
40739406,Efficacy of probiotics in reducing the duration and severity of acute gastroenteritis in children: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"OBJECTIVES: Acute gastroenteritis is a leading global health concern among children, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in treatment, effective management remains a challenge. Probiotics aim to restore gut homeostasis by correcting intestinal dysbiosis. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the severity and duration of diarrhea in children with acute gastroenteritis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across four major databases using the keywords ""acute diarrhea,"" ""pediatric,"" and ""probiotics,"" among others. Only double-arm randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were included, focusing on the efficacy of probiotics in treating pediatric acute diarrhea. Data analysis was performed using Stata 16.0, with a random-effects model applied to account for study variability. RESULTS: Out of 1470 studies screened, 25 RCTs involving 5170 patients (2552 in the probiotic group and 2618 in the placebo group) met the inclusion criteria. Probiotics significantly reduced the overall duration of diarrhea (mean difference [MD]: -7.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -14.60 to -0.91; p = 0.03). Diarrhea frequency was notably reduced on Day 2 (MD: -1.03; 95% CI: -2.06 to 0.00; p = 0.05) and Day 5 (MD: -0.51; 95% CI: -0.83 to -0.18; p = 0.002). Probiotics also significantly reduced the duration of vomiting (MD: -0.19; 95% CI: -0.28 to -0.09; p < 0.01), with a nonsignificant trend in fever reduction. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrates the clinical efficacy of probiotics in reducing the duration of diarrhea and vomiting in children with acute gastroenteritis. Future trials are recommended to further explore the role of specific probiotic strains and combinations to enhance treatment outcomes.",2025 Jul 30

There is limited data about the clinical profile, intensive care needs, and outcomes of children with adenoviral pneumonia from resource-limited settings. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted in the pediatric emergency room (PER) and pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of a tertiary care hospital in North India over a period of a period of 2 years (July 2022 to June 2024). The data collection included demographic and clinical features, laboratory investigations, complications, treatment, intensive care needs, and outcomes. RESULTS: Eighty-five children were enrolled, majority were <1 year of age and males (71.7% each). All presented with fever and respiratory symptoms. The common complications were acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (47%), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (26%), shock (25%), and encephalopathy (25%). PICU admission was needed in 46% of children. The intensive care needs included invasive mechanical ventilation (48%), CPAP (39%), HFNC (9%), vasoactive drugs (25%), IVIG (8%), RRT (6%), and cidofovir (5%). The duration of ER, PICU, and hospital stay was 48 (24-96) hours, 7 (4-14) days, and 9 (5-18) days, respectively. The mortality rate was 22%. On multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of mortality were low admission pH, myocardial dysfunction, acute kidney (AKI), ARDS, shock, encephalopathy, MODS, and healthcare-associated infection (HCAI). CONCLUSION: Infants constituted the largest group of patients requiring admission for adenoviral infection to pediatric emergency in a tertiary care center. Common complications were ARDS, shock, MODS, and encephalopathy. Nearly half required PICU admission for organ support. The mortality rate was 22%; and low admission pH, myocardial dysfunction, AKI, ARDS, shock, encephalopathy, MODS, and HCAI were independent predictors of mortality.

40733721,Recovering Immunogenic Orthohantavirus puumalaense N Protein from Pellets of Recombinant Escherichia coli.,"(1) Background: Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) remains a prevalent zoonosis in Eurasia. Orthohantavirus puumalaense (PUUV), carried by bank voles (Myodes glareolus), is the principal zoonotic pathogen of HFRS in this region. Despite ongoing efforts to develop effective drugs and vaccines against PUUV, this challenge remains. (2) Aim: In this study, we aimed to express a large quantity of the PUUV recombinant N (rN) protein using E. coli. We also sought to develop a protocol for extracting the rN protein from pellets, solubilizing, and refolding it to restore its native form. This protocol is crucial for producing a large quantity of rN protein to develop vaccines and diagnostic tools for HFRS. (3) Methods; PUUV S segment open reading frame (ORF) coding for N protein was synthesized and cloned into the plasmid vector pET-28 (A+). The ORF was transformed, expressed and induced in BL21(DE3) pLysS E. coli strain. Subsequently, rN protein was purified using immobilized metal affinity and ion chromatography. Immune reactivity of rN protein was tested by employing in house and commercial VektoHanta-IgG kit ELISA methods (both in vitro and in vivo). (4) Results: The best conditions for scaling up the expression of the PUUV rN protein were an incubation temperature of 20  degrees C during a 20 h incubation period, followed by induction with 0.5 mM IPTG. The most significant protein yield was achieved when the pellets were incubated in denaturing buffer with 8M urea. The highest yield of refolded proteins was attained using non-denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl) supplemented with arginine. A final 50 muL of PUUV rN protein solution with a concentration of 7 mg/mL was recovered from 1 L of culture. The rN protein elicited an antibody response in vivo and reacted with serum taken from patients with HFRS by ELISA in vitro. (5) Conclusion: Therefore, the orthohantavirus N protein's ability to elicit immune response in vivo suggests that it can be used to develop vaccines against PUUV after conducting in vitro and in vivo studies to ascertain neutralising antibodies.",2025 Jul 10

40730413,Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma in pregnancy.,"A young pregnant woman in her 20s presented with a 2 month history of high-grade intermittent fever. She exhibited multiple painful nodules scattered across her body for 2 months, initially small but progressively increasing in size. Initially diagnosed with Sweet syndrome, a skin biopsy revealed subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, confirmed through immunohistochemistry analysis. Treatment started with antibiotics and antipyretics. Upon ruling out septicaemia, steroid therapy was initiated, resulting in an immediate reduction in fever and rash. However, 2 months post-diagnosis, new lesions emerged, prompting a trial of dapsone, which led to their complete resolution without residual evidence. Subsequently, the case was transitioned to the obstetrician for safe management during parturition. Postpartum imaging unveiled multiple subcutaneous thickenings in the anterior and posterior abdominal walls, anterolateral portion of the right thigh and left perineal regions. After delivery, she was referred to medical oncology due to the emergence of new lesions.",2025 Jul 28
40727494,"Psittacosis, an Uninvited Guest.","Psittacosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacteria Chlamydia psittaci. It commonly presents with flu-like symptoms and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The bacteria is transmitted from birds to humans. The most common bird is parrots. Here, we present a cluster of cases of psittacosis in a family which led to the hospitalization of all the five members of the family. All the five patients presented with fever, weakness, dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion. Chlamydia psittaci immunoglobulin M was detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The family had a history of contact with parrots. The patients were treated with doxycycline and recovered without any complications. Psittacosis is an uncommon cause of CAP which can have a wide range of presentations, from being asymptomatic, to flu-like symptoms or to fulminant disease. Elaborate history and a high degree of suspicion are very important to come to the diagnosis. The infection is easily treatable with appropriate antibiotics.

40727211,Enucleation with Fat Grafting for a True Large Median Palatine Cyst- a Case Report and a Review of Relevant Literature.,"BACKGROUND: Median palatine cysts are uncommon nonodontogenic lesions found in the midline of the hard palate with only 22 cases reported in literature hitherto. Often asymptomatic, they are frequently discovered incidentally during routine clinical examination. We report a case of large median palatine cyst with a novel technique to mitigate the risk of oronasal fistula and give a brief review on the current literature on the entity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 29-year-old male presented with recurrent purulent nasal discharge, right-sided nasal obstruction, fever, and headaches persisting for six months. Clinical examination revealed a mucosa-covered bulge obstructing the right nasal cavity and partially affecting the left. Intraoral examination identified a soft, fluctuant midline palatal swelling communicating with the nasal cavity. Computed tomography revealed a well-circumscribed midline opacity involving the hard palate and nasal cavity. Surgical excision was performed using a U-shaped mucoperiosteal flap. Intraoperatively, a breach in the nasal mucosa was noted, necessitating reconstruction with a buccal fat pad to prevent oronasal fistula formation. RESULT: Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of median palatine cyst, characterised by a fibro-collagenous cyst wall lined by stratified squamous epithelium. Postoperatively, the patient exhibited wound contracture with intact mucosa over the palate. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the importance of timely diagnosis and appropriate surgical management of median palatine cysts to prevent complications such as oronasal fistula. The described surgical approach effectively addressed the cyst while minimizing the risk of postoperative complications, highlighting its efficacy in managing this rare entity. Long-term follow-up is essential to monitor for recurrence and ensure favourable outcomes.",2025 Aug
40727170,Inflammatory Pediatric Grisel Syndrome Secondary to Acute Adenoiditis: A Rare Case Report and Review of Literature.,"Grisel's syndrome is a rare condition characterized by non-traumatic atlantoaxial subluxation, typically secondary to inflammatory processes or surgical interventions in the head and neck region. The literature suggests a rare incidence of approximately 1:100,000,000 per year without gender predilection.The syndrome is often associated with an abnormal head posture and can lead to serious neurological complications if not diagnosed and treated promptly. This paper reviews the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and management strategies for Grisel's syndrome, emphasizing the importance of early recognition to prevent morbidity. A 7-year-old boy presented with torticollis, head tilt to the left, nasal obstruction, purulent nasal discharge, headache, and fever for 3 days. Examination showed painful head tilt to left, with neck rotation to the right and no neurological deficits. Nasopharyngoscopy revealed inflamed adenoid tissue with purulent discharge. CT scan showed a Fielding type I rotatory atlantoaxial subluxation. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics, analgesics, and a cervical collar. He became symptomatically better after 7 days of treatment and on follow-up, he had fully recovered and returned to normal activities. We performed a systematic review of the literature following the preferred reporting items for Systematic reviews. Literature searches were conducted in web-based search engines using MeSH terms and key words. Grisel's syndrome, though rare, should be considered in pediatric patients presenting with painful torticollis following upper respiratory infections or head and neck procedures. Prompt diagnosis through radiographic imaging and early intervention can prevent severe complications and improve patient outcomes.",2025 Aug

40726513,"Characterization of Lumpy Skin Disease in Northern Bangladesh: Clinical, Pathological, Biochemical, and Molecular Perspectives.","Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is an economically important disease of cattle, considered as a threat to the livestock industry. This study aimed to assess the clinical symptoms, gross pathology and histopathology, serum biochemical values, and molecular characterization of LSD in cattle. Cattle in Dinajpur, Thakurgaon, Nilphamari, and Rangpur affected by LSD were initially diagnosed through clinical signs and gross lesions. Blood samples were then collected for biochemical analysis and molecular detection through PCR, and sequencing was performed to characterize the LSD virus (LSDV). The prevalence of LSD in northern areas of Bangladesh was 33.44%. The recorded clinical signs were high fever; firm, raised skin nodules around the head, neck, and limbs; swelling of the limbs and brisket area; and rough hair coat, nasal discharge, dyspnea, corneal opacity, and severe weakness. Grossly, a well-defined, hard swelling of around 1-3.00 cm in diameter in the skin accompanied enlargement of the nearby lymph nodes, and the nodules are composed of a hard, creamy-gray, or yellow clump of the tissue. Histopathologically, ballooning degeneration of the epidermal cell layers, intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies in distinct dermal and epidermal cells, necrosis with substantial infiltration of inflammatory cells, and congested blood vessels in the dermal layer were noted. While total protein, BUN, serum AST, and ALT were increased significantly (p < 0.05), the serum creatinine, GGT, and total albumin were not changed significantly compared with the healthy cattle. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the circulating isolates from northern part of Bangladesh were found in the same clades with India, Pakistan, and Thailand. Thus, this study provides crucial findings on this emerging disease, including its gross and histopathology, serum biochemical properties, and molecular epidemiology in the northern regions of Bangladesh.",2025

PFAPA predominantly affects young children with periodic fever episodes, while BD is rare in pediatrics and presents with mucocutaneous and systemic involvement. This case of an 8-year-old boy with features of both conditions highlights diagnostic challenges and the potential for shared pathogenic mechanisms.",2025 Jul 26
40717932,Acute Pancreatitis Associated with Scrub Typhus: Report of two cases with a brief review of literature.,"Acute pancreatitis is an exceptionally rare complication of scrub typhus. We report 2 cases of scrub typhus-associated acute pancreatitis from a tertiary care centre in Kolkata, India. The first case was a 27-year-old male patient, who presented in 2023, with severe epigastric pain a few days after the onset of fever. Laboratory investigations confirmed acute pancreatitis associated with scrub typhus. He had no additional organ involvement and recovered fully with intravenous doxycycline. The second case, reported in 2024, was a 42-year-old female patient who presented with fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and systemic complications, including acute kidney injury, hepatic dysfunction and pulmonary involvement. Despite the absence of eschar, investigations confirmed the diagnosis of scrub typhus. She achieved full recovery with doxycycline, haemodialysis and other supportive measures. Both cases emphasise the importance of considering scrub typhus in the differential diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in endemic regions, particularly when accompanied by febrile illness.",2025
40717684,Detecting early markers of sepsis in paediatric patient with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time.,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis, a life-threatening organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated host response to infections, poses a critical threat. Cardiac surgery itself induces a robust inflammatory response, further exacerbated by cardiopulmonary bypass, causing notable clinical and physiological changes. Identifying sepsis early in the post-operative period with elevated septic markers becomes challenging, with delayed antibiotic intervention ultimately posing a fatal risk for the patient. METHODS: We performed a prospective observational cross-sectional study aimed at identifying sepsis markers that include total leucocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, platelet count, serum albumin, chest X-ray, blood, urine, and tracheal cultures, procalcitonin, c-reactive protein, serum lactate >2.5 mmol/l along with clinical parameters (fever, hypotension, tachycardia) on post-operative days 1, 3, 5, and 10 in paediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time >100 min. RESULTS: Total leucocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, and platelet counts were not significant enough to detect early sepsis, especially in patients with prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass time. Chest X-ray was significant from post-operative day 3 onwards. Procalcitonin was significant from day 5, and C-reactive protein was significant only from day 10. Among the clinical parameters, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and elevated lactate levels were significant from post-operative day 1 in the patients developing sepsis. CONCLUSION: Neonates and infants faced a higher sepsis risk than older children. Longer cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic clamp times correlated with increased sepsis likelihood. Clinical factors outweighed laboratory indicators for early sepsis detection post-cardiac surgery, prompting prompt investigation and intervention.",2025 Jul 28

40715741,New insights on pharmacological potential of montelukast: a comprehensive review.,"Leukotrienes are strong lipid mediators that mainly act through particular leukotriene receptors to produce a broad range of clinical effects. These receptors facilitate the complex biochemical and physiological responses associated with leukotrienes. An examination of their roles in various diseases reveals the pharmacological effects of anti-leukotriene agents, specifically their ability to modulate inflammatory responses within the body. Recent research has focused on the dual nature of these lipids, revealing that they may trigger a mild inflammatory response, which is a key significant factor in neurological diseases, cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndromes, renal difficulties, liver damage, and cancer. Among the available modulators, Montelukast is distinguished as a particularly effective orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist. In the United States and around the world, it has been available and generally approved for the treatment of hay fever and asthma for more than 11 years. It is frequently recommended as an adjuvant to low-dose inhaled corticosteroids for patients who need additional medication, or as an alternative first-line treatment for pediatric asthma, even in cases with mild, persistent symptoms. Apart from anti-asthmatic and anti-allergic activities, Montelukast has numerous pharmacological activities such as anticancer, neuroprotective, anti-osteoporotic, renal protective, liver protective, cardioprotective, anti-arthritic effects, and other beneficial effects on the body. Montelukast operates through a highly effective mechanism that makes it a potent ally in the battle against various respiratory conditions, including asthma and hay fever.",2025 Jul 26
40715601,"Identification of potential VP40 inhibitor of Marburg virus through molecular docking, pharmacokinetic analysis and molecular dynamics simulation.","West Africa has been experiencing a resurgence of Marburg virus disease (MVD), a zoonotic pathogen that causes severe hemorrhagic fever in both humans and primates. Regretfully, there are not any effective medications on the market right now. The binding interactions between MARV VP40, a protein essential to viral replication, and a commercial medication, estradiol benzoate, and a natural substance, procyanidin, were examined in this work. Ten hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with important residues (Ala316, Val317, Lys230, Glu89, Asn87) stabilized procyanidin's superior binding affinity (- 11.3 kcal/mol) over estradiol benzoate (- 8.9 kcal/mol), according to molecular docking. With a lower radius of gyration (1.94 nm) and RMSD (0.28 nm) than estradiol benzoate (RMSD: 0.37 nm, Rg: 1.97 nm), procyanidin formed a more stable complex, according to molecular dynamics simulations conducted over 200 ns. Additionally, procyanidin showed decreased solvent accessibility and increased intermolecular hydrogen bonding (average 3.50 bonds), suggesting stronger binding. Procyanidin's superior drug-likeness, decreased cardiotoxicity, and decreased carcinogenicity potential were all shown by ADMET analysis. Its higher binding energy (- 57.82 KJ/mol) was further validated by free energy calculations (MM-PBSA). According to these results, procyanidin, a natural substance shows promise as an antiviral medication against MARV targeting its VP40 protein.",2025 Jul 25
40715493,Evaluation of APACHE II score as predictor of outcome in patients with ruptured liver abscess: prospective study in a tertiary care hospital.,"Ruptured liver abscess is a critical condition with high morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with systemic comorbidities. This 18-month observational cohort study at Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi, evaluated the prognostic value of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) score in predicting outcomes for patients with radiologically confirmed ruptured liver abscesses. A total of 69 patients (88.4% male, mean age 44 years) were included. The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain (100%) and fever (76.8%). Treatment modalities included percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD) in 46.4% of patients, open surgical drainage in 34.8%, and conservative management in the remainder. Patients undergoing surgical drainage had significantly higher APACHE II scores (mean 9 +/- 4) than those treated with PCD (mean 7 +/- 3; p = 0.041). The overall mortality rate was 21%, with mortality significantly higher in the surgical group (45.8%) compared to the PCD group (3.1%; p = 0.000). An APACHE II score > 9 was strongly associated with increased mortality and the need for surgery (p = 0.010). Colonic involvement was seen in 41.6% of surgical cases, with 10 cases presenting with colonic perforation. Higher APACHE II scores correlated with longer hospital stays and more severe complications. The study concludes that the APACHE II score is an effective prognostic tool for assessing disease severity and guiding treatment in ruptured liver abscess cases. PCD is favoured for stable patients, while surgical intervention is necessary for those with high APACHE II scores, failed drainage, or colonic involvement, emphasizing the importance of early risk stratification. This study has its limitations of being single centric with a sample size of 69 patients.",2025 Jul 26
40715163,Clinical and molecular epidemiology of chikungunya outbreaks during 2019-2022 in India.,"Chikungunya fever (CHIKF) is endemic in India, with multiple outbreaks occurring across the country since its reemergence in 2005. Suspected CHIKF patients were recruited from four clinical sites during 2019-2022, with data collected on sociodemographic, clinical, and epidemiological aspects. Sera samples were screened for IgM, IgG antibodies and viral RNA along with their neutralizing capacity. Envelope genes of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) isolated were sequenced and further analysed. A total of 1312 suspected patients were screened during the study period; 258 patients were laboratory-confirmed with CHIKV infection. Severe clinical manifestation was observed in the patients during the viremic phase of infection. The neutralization potential was found to be increasing proportionally with the onset of illness, coinciding with the rise of IgG antibodies. Three of the four clinical sites had reported CHIKF outbreaks at different time points during the study period, and a distinct pattern of clinical presentation was observed across the sites. Phylogenetic and network analyses of E1, E2 and E3 genes from 62 CHIKV isolates demonstrated their evolution within the country. This study provides preliminary evidence of spatial and temporal variation in the clinical presentation and molecular evolution of virus in CHIKF outbreaks across India.",2025 Jul 26
40707092,Clinical spectrum of tuberculosis in adolescents (10-19 years) in a tertiary care center of North India.,"BACKGROUND\OBJECTIVES: There is limited literature available to characterize tuberculosis (TB) in adolescents despite them sharing a high burden of the disease. Ours is the first prospective study in India and worldwide to study the clinical profile of tuberculosis in adolescents aged 10-19 years. METHODS: We enrolled 82 children and adolescents between March 2021 to March 2022. The diagnosis of TB was made on the basis of National Tuberculosis Elimination Program (NTEP) guidelines 2020. Adolescents were divided into 3 age groups: early (10-13 years), middle (14-17 years), and late adolescents (18-19 years)and the results were compared among the three groups. A two-sided p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The middle age adolescents comprised majority of our study population and females were more than males. The common presenting features were fever, chest pain, breathing difficulty with majority belonging to lower socioeconomic status. The pulmonary TB accounted for 56% and extrapulmonary constituted 44% of the cases. The notable extrapulmonary cases were disseminated TB with secondary lymphangiectasia, compressive myelopathy, sacroiliac joint arthropathy among others. Infiltrates/consolidation were the most frequent radiological findings in patients with pulmonary TB. The microbiological confirmation was available in 44% of the cases. The microbiological positivity was higher in histopathological specimens and in late adolescents. Two patients were rifampicin resistant. CONCLUSION: There was a varied clinical presentation of TB in this population. The extrapulmonary cases as well as the microbiological yield increased with increasing age of the cases.",2025 Jul

40704221,Intersectoral collaboration in zoonotic disease surveillance and response: A One Health study in the Greater Accra metropolitan area of Ghana.,"The One Health (OH) approach is essential for preventing and managing zoonotic diseases through the promotion of intersectoral collaboration. Integrated surveillance systems enhance resource efficiency, support targeted interventions, and provide a comprehensive understanding of disease dynamics. However, operationalizing OH in resource-limited contexts encounters various obstacles due to systemic limitations. This study explores intersectoral collaboration across sectors engaged in zoonotic disease surveillance and response (ZDSR) in Ghana at the district level, identifying key operational gaps. We performed 46 key informant interviews with actors in the human, animal and wildlife health sectors directly involved in ZDSR. We developed an interview guide informed by WHO's Components of Surveillance and Response Systems for Monitoring and Evaluation Framework and the Evaluation of collaboration in a multisectoral surveillance system (ECoSur) tool. The responses were analyzed using a content analysis approach. The results showed that for district-level surveillance activities, relationships between the human and animal health sectors existed in 87.5 % of districts, albeit weak, while the wildlife sector was absent. Rabies/dog bites, Avian Influenza, Lassa fever and COVID-19 were the primary triggers of intersectoral collaboration. Anthrax, zoonotic tuberculosis and trypanosomiasis saw minimal intersectoral collaboration. Collaborative activities were mostly addressed through reactive and event-driven approaches focusing on case-specific data sharing, alerts in outbreak events, and committee participation. However, core surveillance functions like disease detection, data analysis, and data management practices were performed in siloes. These results highlight the need for adaptable, proactive, and systemic frameworks that enhance intersectoral collaboration for the surveillance of neglected zoonotic diseases in Ghana.",2025 Dec
40703960,Dengue in older inpatients in the post-COVID-19 Period: a case series from a North Indian tertiary center.,"Studies on dengue in older patients are scarce from India. The patterns of dengue in the post-COVID-19 period have been poorly studied globally. Our case series describes the patterns and outcomes of dengue in inpatients of the geriatric unit of a tertiary university hospital in North India during the period of August -December 2023. Twenty-four patients were diagnosed with dengue out of 182 admissions during the study period (13.2 %). The median (Q1-Q3) age of patients was 67.5 (64.75-75) years. Fever was present in all except one patient (95.8 %). Weakness, vomiting, dyspnea, and altered sensorium occurred in 41.7 %, 37.5 %, 29.2 %, and 20.8 %, respectively. Hyponatremia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were observed in 58.3 %, 45.8 %, and 25 % of cases, and nearly one-third developed hepatitis. Leucopenia rates were relatively low. Dengue was severe in two-thirds, and acute kidney injury was the commonest complication. Three fatalities were observed. In summary, many older patients had atypical presentations of dengue, and the disease was severe in a significant proportion. Larger multi-centric surveillance studies with the inclusion of immunogenic correlates of COVID-19 are needed to understand its effects if any on the age and region-specific variations of dengue in the elderly.",2025
40699988,Bilateral Pyosalpinx Mimicking Acute Appendicitis: An Uncommon but Critical Diagnostic Challenge.,"A perforated appendix has been believed to be a potential risk for damage to adnexal structures that may escalate the chances of infertility in girls in future. Acute complications that are uncommomly described postperforation of appendix may be salpingitis, hydrosalpinx, and pyosalpinx. A pyosalpinx or tubal abscess is the acute inflammation of the fallopian tube that fills up and swells with pus, which commonly results from inadequate or delayed treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Pyosalpinx may present with common symptoms such as lower abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, per vaginal discharge, and lesser noted symptoms such as fever and chills or remain silent. Primay pyosalpinx might occur as a severe sequelae of PID that is characterized by the inflammation of upper genital tract incorporating endometritis, salpingitis, and pelvic peritonitis. Secondary pyosalpinx, on the other hand, arises from adjacent pelvic structures such as appendix, colon, urinary bladder or may be from a pelvic malignancy. Herein, we report the case of acute appendicitis with bilateral pyosalpinx.",2025 Jul 23
40697682,Prevalence and patterns of self-medication practices in India: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Self-medication is a growing concern globally, particularly in countries like India, due to its potential implications on public health. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence and patterns of self-medication practices in India. PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Embase were searched for studies reporting on the prevalence of self-medication in India and published between 2000 and October 2023. R software was used for analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted on moderators including geographical region, study population, sample size, and publication year. Heterogeneity was assessed using I(2) statistic. Qualitative synthesis analyzed reasons, conditions, information sources, and drug categories associated with self-medication. Sixty-six studies involving 29,873 participants were included. Pooled prevalence of self-medication in India was 64.4%. While the northern region of India had the highest rate at 81.9%, no significant difference was observed among other regions. Self-medication practices among students from the non-healthcare domain exhibited highest rate (86.1%), followed by students from healthcare domain (79.0%) and general population (59.7%). Studies with smaller sample sizes showed a higher prevalence (71.6%) of self-medication than those with larger sample sizes (55.8%). Major reasons for self-medication included perceptions of minor illness, time constraints, and financial restrictions. Common indications for which self-medication was done included fever, headache, and cough/cold. Pharmacists, past prescriptions, and advice from friends/family were leading sources of information. Analgesics, antipyretics, antibiotics, and cough remedies were the most commonly self-medicated drugs. Self-medication is highly prevalent in India. Targeted interventions are needed to address the potential harms of self-medication, ensuring safe and informed practices among the population.",2025 Jul-Aug
40696644,Diagnosis and outcomes of fever of unknown origin cases with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 100 mm/h or more: An International ID-IRI (Infectious Diseases - International Research Initiative) Observational Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Herein, we aimed to analyze the final diagnosis in a well-defined cohort of fever of unknown origin (FUO) cases whose erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 100 mm/h or more during the admission. The subgroup of the FUO patients with an ESR of 100 mm/h or more during the FUO evaluation, was extracted from the study database of a previously published multicenter study (European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases. April 15, 2023;42 (4):387-98). Data for 139 patients (17.6%, 139/788 of the original cohort) who fulfilled the study inclusion criteria, were obtained from 29 centers from 11 countries. Infections, neoplasms, and noninfectious inflammatory diseases were found to be the reason of fever in [n = 74 (53.2%)], [n = 14 (10%)], and [n = 13 (9.3%)] of 139 patients, respectively. Regardless of the diseases subgroup top 6 diseases that were determined to be the reasons of FUO were tuberculosis [n = 15 (10.8%)], HIV/AIDS [n = 13 (9.3%)], urinary tract infection [n = 9 (6.5%)], infective endocarditis [n = 9 (6.5%)], lymphoma [n = 9 (6.5%)], and abscess [n = 9 (6.5%)]. The most common infectious diseases were tuberculosis (15/74, 20.2%), HIV/AIDS (13/74, 17.5%), and infective endocarditis (9/74, 12.1%), along with urinary tract infection [n = 9 (6.5%)] and abscess [n = 9 (6.5%)]. The most common noninfectious inflammatory diseases were adult onset Still disease (3/13, 23%) and giant cell arteritis, also known as temporal arteritis (3/13, 23%), and followed by polyarteritis nodosa (2/13, 15.3%). The most common neoplasm was lymphoma (9/14, 64.2%), followed by lung cancer (2/14, 14.2%). Reason of fever could not be defined in (29/139, 20.8%) patients. The invasive procedures were performed in (64/139, 46%) patients. Gender, age > 50 or not, and income level (high-middle-low) of the participating country were not associated with a significant difference in the final diagnosis category of the FUO case (P > .05). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the FUO in the subgroup of cases with extreme ESR elevation and infectious diseases comprised the most cause of the FUO in this particular subgroup.",2025 Jul 18
40693676,Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis triggered by Rickettsia conorii.,"Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare complication of rickettsial infections. We report a 50-y-old man from northern India who presented with fever, respiratory distress, altered sensorium and an eschar. Despite treatment with doxycycline, his condition deteriorated with multi-organ dysfunction. PCR and sequencing from the eschar confirmed Rickettsia conorii. Bone marrow examination, elevated ferritin and triglycerides, as well as an H-score of 224 confirmed HLH. The patient was treated with corticosteroids but succumbed to refractory ventricular arrhythmias. A high index of suspicion is essential in rickettsial infections that present with multi-organ dysfunction, as early recognition of HLH enables the prompt initiation of treatment of the underlying disease and adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy.

40693090,Recurrent Chyluria Revisited: Lymphangiographic Diagnosis of Pyelolymphatic Fistula With Insights on Endolymphatic Interventions.,"Chyluria, the passage of chyle-laden lymph into urine, is most frequently linked to filarial infection but may also occur in diverse nonparasitic settings. We describe a 43-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, and rheumatic heart disease who was admitted with prolonged fever and dyspnea and found to have infective endocarditis. The patient developed persistent milky urine during hospitalization that was unresponsive to a high-protein, low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglycerides. Filariasis serology was negative. Although his comorbidities are not primary etiologic factors for chyluria, the systemic inflammation and lymphatic congestion associated with endocarditis likely triggered central lymphatic obstruction, the reflux of chyle into the renal lymphatics, and chyluria. Diagnostic intranodal lymphangiography with Lipiodol delineated multiple left-sided pyelolymphatic fistulae. No additional embolic agent was administered; nonetheless, Lipiodol's inherent inflammatory and embolic effects led to the complete resolution of chyluria within 24 hours. This case underscores the value of thorough etio-pathological assessment in nonparasitic chyluria, highlights structural lymphatic abnormalities as pivotal contributors to disease persistence, and demonstrates the evolving dual diagnostic-therapeutic role of intranodal lymphangiography. We further review current imaging algorithms and minimally invasive endolymphatic interventions that can obviate surgical treatment in refractory chyluria.",2025 Jun

This case report highlights an atypical presentation of CSD in a 30-year-old female pet groomer with prolonged fever, fatigue, and axillary lymphadenopathy. The patient's diagnosis was confirmed through histopathological findings of necrotizing granulomas and subsequent improvement after targeted antibiotic therapy with azithromycin. The case emphasizes the diagnostic challenges posed by atypical presentations of CSD, especially in regions with high cat exposure. This case also underscores the importance of considering CSD in the differential diagnosis of febrile lymphadenopathy and highlights the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in symptom resolution.",2025 Jul
40692505,Burden of Chikungunya Fever and Its Economic and Social Impacts Worldwide: A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the social and economic impacts and disease burden of Chikungunya Fever globally through a systematic literature review. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search through MEDLINE (via PubMed), LILACS, and Embase databases, and grey literature, including studies of populations diagnosed with Chikungunya Fever or at risk of infection published in English, Spanish, French, or Portuguese, without date restrictions. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. Methodological quality was assessed using different tools. RESULTS: Forty-three publications were included. Until 2013, publications originated solely from the Asian and African continents. From 2015 onwards, South America emerged as the predominant source. Publications were classified as cost studies (25), including cost-of-illness (18) and program cost (6); burden of disease studies (10); cost-outcome studies (4), including cost-effectiveness (3) and cost-utility (1); and quality-of-life studies (15). Reported total direct costs associated with Chikungunya Fever ranged from US$ 3.5 million (US Virgin Islands, 2014-2015) to US$ 83.6 billion (Region of the Americas, 2013-2015). Direct medical costs varied from US$ 308.94 (Tamil Nadu, India, 2006) to US$ 33.7 million (Reunion Island, 2005-2006). Vector control program costs ranged from US$ 888,000 annually (Greece, 2013-2017) to US$ 466 million (Brazil, 2016). Estimated disability-adjusted life years per 100,000 population ranged from 4.53 (India, 2006) to 2432 (Region of the Americas, 2013-2015). Quality-of-life studies demonstrated substantial declines across multiple domains, indicating significant functional impairment due to Chikungunya Fever. CONCLUSION: Chikungunya Fever imposes a considerable economic and social burden, surpassing that of other endemic arboviral diseases such as dengue and yellow fever. These findings underscore the need for further research to accurately quantify the full scope of Chikungunya Fever-related costs and impacts on affected populations.",2025 Jul 22
40688822,Microbial Spectrum of Acute Encephalitis Syndrome With Special Reference to Non-Japanese Encephalitis Cases.,"BACKGROUND: Northeast India is endemic for Japanese encephalitis (JE), which causes acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Though there is no specific therapy for JE, many etiological agents of AES are treatable. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the AES cases for their etiologies, laboratory parameters, and associated clinical manifestations. METHODS: A hospital-based prospective observational study was carried out, enrolling all consecutive cases of AES satisfying the World Health Organization (WHO) definition. Blood was tested for the malaria parasite. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were processed by Gram staining, India ink staining for Cryptococcus, Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), and culture for other bacteria and fungi. Serum and CSF samples lacking the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) IgM were processed for the detection of other etiologies. The CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect Enterovirus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and herpes simplex virus, and serum IgM enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) detected scrub typhus, Leptospira, dengue, chikungunya, and West Nile antibodies. RESULTS: Out of 395 AES cases tested, 77 were found to be positive for non-JE etiologies. Of these, dengue virus (n=32/371; 8.6%) was the most common, followed by scrub typhus (n=16/348; 4.6%) and Leptospira (n=10/362; 2.8%). Positive cases showed CSF pleocytosis (>5 WBC/cumm) and significantly higher protein level (n=6/11; 55%) and sugar level (n=8/11; 73%) in Streptococcus pneumoniae. All cases presented with fever (n=11/11; 100%), followed by altered mental status (n=18/19; 94.7%) and seizure (n=22/32; 68.7%). CONCLUSION: The number of non-JE causes of AES in Assam is higher. Scrub typhus, dengue virus, and Leptospira are other major infectious etiologies of AES that are treatable. Timely diagnosis of such cases will help reduce AES-related complications and mortality.",2025 Jun
40688420,H1N1-associated acute leukoencephalopathy: An unusual presentation in a young adult indian male.,"The H1N1 virus commonly causes symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, which have a self-limited course in most cases. Neurological complications are rare, especially in adults. This case illustrates H1N1-associated acute leukoencephalopathy in a young adult with a favorable outcome and no lasting neurological deficits. The initial presentation included fever, sore throat, and myalgia, evolving into neurological symptoms, including dysarthria, nystagmus, and left-sided motor weakness. Comprehensive laboratory tests ruled out common bacterial, viral, or autoimmune causes, while MRI findings suggested acute leukoencephalopathy of infectious or toxic etiology. Although the urine toxicology screen showed traces of phenol, clinical evidence did not correlate with toxic exposure and pointed towards an infectious origin. A throat swab for Influenza/H1N1 PCR confirmed the diagnosis. Treatment with oseltamivir and methylprednisolone led to symptomatic improvement with no sequelae.",2025
40685242,Neonatal complications and referral practices at birth: insights from a population-based study in the Indian state of Bihar.,"OBJECTIVES: To explore neonatal survival by type of neonatal complications at birth and referral pattern for these complications by place of delivery. SETTING: Bihar, India. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 15-49 years who had given live birth between July 2020 and June 2021. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MEASURES: Prevalence of neonatal complications at birth, referral pattern by complication and neonatal deaths by type of complication. RESULTS: Data were available for 6767 (81.8%) newborns including 717 neonatal deaths. The prevalence of at least one neonatal complication at birth was reported for 32.9% (95% CI 32.4 to 33.4) newborns, with the most common complications including difficulty in breathing (21.9%), high fever (20.7%), low birth weight (12.5%) and jaundice (13.2%). A total of 578 (26.6%; 95% CI 25.8 to 27.4) neonates with complications at birth were referred to another health provider, predominantly to private sector (68.1%, 93% and 78.7% from public facility, private facility and home). The complications with high referrals included meconium aspiration syndrome (64.1%; 95% CI: 61.1 to 67.1), inability to pass urine (54.7%; 95% CI: 42.1 to 67.2), difficulty in suckling (49.7%; 95% CI: 46.9 to 52.5), cold to touch (48.5%; 95% CI: 43.5 to 53.6), inability to cry (47.2%; 95% CI: 44.2 to 50.1), pneumonia (45.6%; 95% CI: 42.0 to 49.1), difficulty in breathing (44.0%; 95% CI: 42.5 to 45.6) and lethargy (43.5%; 95% CI: 38.4 to 48.6). Referrals were linked to higher neonatal deaths, in particular, among neonates born at home and referred for complications (84.7%; p<0.001) compared with those born in public facilities (59.8%) or private facilities (47.3%) and referred for complications. CONCLUSIONS: With one-third of the neonates reported to have complications at birth and those referred more likely to die, critical gaps in addressing neonatal complications at birth and improvement in the referral services are urgently needed to reduce neonatal mortality.",2025 Jul 20
40684877,Peptide-driven lateral flow platform for detection of classical swine fever viral antigen.,"Classical Swine Fever (CSF) is a highly contagious viral disease that causes substantial economic losses in the swine industry. Timely detection of CSFV infection is essential for effective disease control; however, current antibody-based diagnostic methods are limited due to the delayed host immune response. In this study, we developed a novel peptide-based lateral flow assay (LFA) targeting the E2 antigen of the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV) to enable rapid and field-deployable detection. A synthetic peptide derived from the immunodominant region of the CSFV E2 protein was identified through bioinformatics analysis, synthesized, and conjugated to Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) to enhance its immunogenicity. Polyclonal antibodies were generated in rabbits, purified, and validated via ELISA to confirm specificity to CSFV, showing no cross-reactivity with other swine viruses such as ASFV, PRRSV, PCV2, and PPV. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were biosynthesized using Mangifera indica leaf extract and characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). These nanoparticles were then conjugated to the purified anti-E2 antibodies and incorporated into LFA strips. The resulting assay exhibited high sensitivity, capable of detecting CSFV antigen concentrations as low as 20 ng/ml, with excellent specificity and no cross-reactivity. This peptide-based LFA provides a rapid, reliable, and cost-effective diagnostic tool for on-site CSF surveillance and outbreak management.",2025 Jul 18
40684150,COVID-19 infection and its association with severe malaria & dengue: an epidemiological study from Southern India.,"BACKGROUND: Post-Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) sequelae involve complex biological processes that can alter the progression and clinical outcome of other infectious diseases. However, there is no documented information on the influence of COVID-19 on the development of severe malaria and dengue. Hence, this study was conducted to determine the association between malaria & dengue and previous COVID-19 infection among the adult population of Mangalore Taluk and to describe the socio-demographic and clinical correlates of malaria & dengue. METHODS: This case-control study was conducted among 293 participants who were positive for either malaria or dengue from November 2022 to August 2024. Data were collected using a proforma which contained sections on demographic details, clinical profile and comorbidities, history of COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccination status. The participants were categorised into having severe disease and mild to moderate disease based on operational definitions. The data were analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 29. Chi-square test was done, and a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Binary Logistic Regression analyses were used and odds ratios were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 293 participants were included in the study with a mean age of 36.7 (SD:14.8) years. Among them, 23.9% (n = 70) had malaria and 76.1% (n = 223) had dengue. Out of those who had malaria, 30% (n = 21) developed severe illness, whereas among those who had dengue 35.8% (n = 80) developed severe dengue. Overall, 58.4% (n = 171) were in the age group of > 30 years. In total, 98.1% (n = 52) of the participants with dengue fever with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe dengue, (aOR:55.93 (95% CI:7.17-435.92) p < 0.001) compared to those without. Similarly, 85.7% (n = 12) of the participants with a history of COVID-19 infection developed severe malaria (aOR: 263.7 (95% CI: 34.9-1987.4) p < 0.001) compared to those and these differences were found to be statistically significant. In addition, those participants belonging to lower socio-economic classes had higher chances of developing severe dengue than those belonging to the upper socio-economic class (p < 0.001*). CONCLUSION: Those with a prior history of COVID-19 infection had higher chances of developing severe malaria and dengue than those without a history of COVID-19 infection.",2025 Jul 19
40683139,A template tool for the evaluation of vaccines for emerging pathogens to be used for pregnant and breast-feeding women.,"Vaccination during pregnancy provides effective protection against pathogens that increase the risk of maternal and infant morbidity and mortality for mothers and their infants. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrated the need for the inclusion of pregnant and breast-feeding women in research and development of vaccines for emerging pathogens, such as Ebola, Zika, Lassa fever, Chikungunya, and influenza virus of pandemic potential. The COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Maternal Immunization Working Group (MIWG), in collaboration with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation and the Safety Platform for Emergency Vaccines (CEPI-SPEAC) developed a standardized template with key considerations to guide the assessment of vaccines against emerging pathogens in pregnant and breast-feeding women. The aim of this tool is to enable key stakeholders to perform an early structured assessment of the overall potential benefit and risk for maternal immunization against an emerging pathogen. It can also be used to support risk management and pharmacovigilance planning, communication strategies, policy development, and acceptance of vaccination during pregnancy in future pandemics.",2025 Jul 18
40682866,"Detection of naturally occuring mixed infection of Theileria lestoquardi and Theileria annulata in buffalo, in Pakistan.","Theileriosis caused by Theileria lestoquardi (malignant ovine theileriosis) in sheep and Theileria annulata (topical theileriosis) in cattle, is a tick-borne hemoprotozoal disease that causes major economic losses in animal production caused by a tick-transmitted haemoprotozoan Theileria species, infecting various domestic and wild animals. It is a threat to the buffalo population in Pakistan due to high mortality rates and economic losses. Extensive mixed farming in Pakistan poses threats due to mixed infections and increased mortality rates. The current case report describes the mixed infection and characterization of Theileria lestoquardi with Theileria annulata in a buffalo raised in a mixed farming setup, in Pakistan. A 6.5-year-old female buffalo presented at the Outdoor Hospital exhibiting swollen sub-scapular lymph nodes, pale mucous membranes, a high fever (41.5 degrees C), dullness, depression, shortness of breath, and a decrease in milk production. Investigation through microscopy, hematology, and PCR confirmed that the buffalo was suffering from theileriosis. A Giemsa-stained thin blood smear showed piroplasms indicating theileriosis. Hematological analysis of the blood revealed lower values for hemoglobin and red blood cells (RBCs), while higher counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes were observed during the infection. The PCR performed on the blood sample was positive for Theileria spp. using RLB universal primers and T. annulata-specific primers. The sequence revealed similarity with T. lestoquardi reported in Pakistan, Iran, Tunisia, and India. The buffalo was treated with Bupralex(R) and Oxtra LA(R) at a dosage of 1ml/20kg of body weight I/M, respectively, along with supportive treatment. Despite these interventions, the animal died probably due to damage to cardiac muscles. This study reports the first case of T. annulata mixed infection with T. lestoquardi in a buffalo in Punjab, Pakistan. It can be concluded that mixed farming exacerbates the epidemiology and spread of ovine malignant theileriosis and mortalities possibly due to cardiac arrest in mixed infections.",2025 Jul 13
40682584,Stent Infection Leading to Coronary Aneurysm and Coronary Cameral Fistula.,"BACKGROUND: Coronary stent infection (SI) is a rare but catastrophic complication, occurring in 0.3% to 6% of cases post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Early diagnosis and surgical interventions are crucial for definitive diagnosis and management. CASE SUMMARY: A 52-year-old man underwent PCI for an inferior wall myocardial infarction to the left circumflex artery (LCx) with a single sirolimus-eluting stent. He developed a fever 10 days later due to methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Imaging showed a coronary cameral fistula with a left atrial appendage (LAA) mycotic aneurysm. He was treated with antibiotics, stent explantation, abscess drainage, and fistula repair; however, he developed refractory vasoplegia and died 2 days post-surgery. DISCUSSION: Coronary SI requires a high index of suspicion. The use of multimodality imaging and multidisciplinary approaches to diagnose and manage infection is essential. Late and complicated stent infections have a high mortality rate. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Coronary SI is an important differential diagnosis for fever post-PCI. Prompt diagnosis, multimodality imaging, and early intervention are needed.",2025 Jun 20

40675253,"Outbreak of leptospirosis caused by Leptospira wolffii with HAV coinfections in lower Assam, Northeast India in 2024: Clinical impact and public health implications.","BACKGROUND: In February-March 2024, an outbreak of unknown fever and jaundice with multiple fatalities was reported in Goalpara District, Assam, India. This study aimed to identify the etiological agents responsible for the outbreak to guide public health interventions. METHODS: Clinical samples from 30 individuals were collected and analyzed using serological and molecular techniques. Serological testing for Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), and Leptospira was performed using IgM ELISA kits. Leptospira DNA was extracted and amplified using PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene, followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) for further analysis. RESULTS: The results revealed HAV IgM antibodies in 23.33 % of cases (7/30), while 40 % (12/30) tested positive for Leptospira-specific IgM by ELISA. Additionally, PCR targeting the 16S rRNA gene confirmed Leptospira DNA in 53.33 % of the urine samples (8/15). Notably, 16.67 % (5/30) of cases exhibited coinfection with both HAV and Leptospira spp., challenging the clinical outcome. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of PCR-positive samples identified Leptospira wolffii (L. wolffii) as the causative agent, marking the first report of L. wolffii in human clinical samples from Northeastern India. Recently, L. wolffii, a member of the P2 subclade of Leptospira, has garnered attention due to its pathogenic potential. CONCLUSION: The findings along with reported fatalities, emphasize the pathogenic potential of L. wolffii and its likely introduction into the region, via cross-border transmission from neighboring Bangladesh, where the strain is prevalent. This study highlights the need for enhanced surveillance and research to monitor emerging Leptospira strains, particularly L. wolffii, in both human and animal populations, to better understand its epidemiology, pathogenicity, and public health implications.",2025 Jul 15

40665219,The global burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever from 1990 to 2021 and the impact on prevention and control.,"BACKGROUND: Typhoid and paratyphoid fever are common infectious diseases and remain a heavy burden, especially in some low-income countries. Although the global burden has decreased over the past three decades, an analysis of the burden of typhoid and paratyphoid fever will help inform public health strategies. METHODS: This study is aimed to comprehensively evaluate the global, regional, and national burden of typhoid and paratyphoid, and the temporal trends while exploring potential associations with socio-demographic development over three decades (1990-2021). Data on typhoid and paratyphoid fever were analyzed using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study in 2021. For this analysis, we calculated to demonstrate temporal trends in the incidence, mortality, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) of typhoid and paratyphoid fever from 1990 to 2021. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, both typhoid and paratyphoid fever showed declining trends globally and in different socio-demographic index (SDI) regions, including incidence, mortality, and DALYs. For typhoid fever worldwide, new cases decreased by 62.12%, with an EAPC of -3.92 (-4.14, -3.71); deaths decreased by 50.65%, EAPC - 2.83 (-2.99, -2.66), and DALYs decreased by 52.30%, EAPC - 2.82 (-3.00, -2.64). For paratyphoid fever, new cases decreased by 73.15%, with an EAPC of -4.77 (-5.29, -4.26); deaths decreased by 65.44%, EAPC - 3.74 (-4.24, -3.24), and DALYs decreased by 68.42%, EAPC - 3.87 (-4.42, -3.31). For both typhoid and paratyphoid fever, children had the highest morbidity and mortality rates; males had higher rates of incidence, mortality, and DALYs than females. However, among older patients, the absolute number of new cases and DALYs was higher in women. The burden is concentrated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania, with only South Asia suffering severely from paratyphoid fever. Regarding typhoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of incidence are Burkina Faso (328.48) (SDI: 0.285), Bangladesh (303.14) (SDI: 0.492), and Papua New Guinea (299.45) (SDI: 418) which are in Western Sub-Saharan, South Asia, and Oceania. The top three countries in terms of mortality and DALYs are Bhutan (5.61; 434.23) (SDI: 0.473), Bangladesh (5.06; 382.38), and Burkina Faso (4.64; 352.57). Regarding paratyphoid fever, the top three countries with the highest ASRs of mortality and DALYs are the same, including Pakistan (1.05; 72.66), India (0.75; 53.42), and Nepal (0.72; 50.65) (SDI: 0.433), all of which are located in South Asia.",2025 Jul 15
40662738,Role of cycle threshold values in predicting poor outcomes in patients with Kyasanur Forest disease: a retrospective cohort study.,"BACKGROUND: Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) is a tick-borne viral haemorrhagic illness endemic to southern India. Early identification of patients at risk for poor outcomes remains a clinical challenge. The study aimed to evaluate the role of cycle threshold (Ct) values in predicting outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with PCR-confirmed KFD admitted to a tertiary care hospital in South India between January 2019 and December 2024. The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of mortality. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the prognostic performance of Ct values. RESULTS: Among 213 patients, 20 (9.4%) died. Mortality was independently associated with lower Ct values, older age, lower respiratory tract involvement, altered sensorium, and elevated white blood cell counts on multivariable analysis. ROC analysis yielded an area under the curve of 0.675 for Ct value alone. A Ct cut-off >/=27.75 predicted survival with 68.4% sensitivity and 70.0% specificity. CONCLUSION: Lower Ct values are independently associated with increased mortality in KFD and may serve as a pragmatic tool for early risk stratification, especially in resource-limited settings.",2025 Dec
40659376,NXP-2-positive polymyositis associated with scrub typhus.,"Polymyositis (PM), a rare autoimmune inflammatory myopathy, typically presents with symmetric proximal muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes. A muscle biopsy is confirmatory for the diagnosis. We report a case of a woman in her 30s with scrub typhus and anti-nuclear matrix protein 2 (NXP2) positive PM. The patient presented with fever, proximal muscle weakness, dysphagia and serologically confirmed scrub typhus a month prior. Laboratory investigations revealed a positive ELISA IgM for scrub typhus, elevated creatine kinase and elevated transaminases, leading to a provisional diagnosis of scrub myositis. However, further investigations, including electromyography, nerve conduction studies, muscle biopsy and the detection of myositis-specific anti-NXP-2 antibodies suggested PM. The patient was successfully treated with corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine, resulting in significant improvement of symptoms. This case highlights the importance of considering idiopathic inflammatory myopathy in patients with persistent muscle weakness and pain and underscores the need for a comprehensive diagnostic approach to ensure prompt and effective treatment.",2025 Jul 13

40655683,Hepatocellular Carcinoma in South Indian Population: Clinical Profile and AFP Correlation with Radiological Tumor Size.,"OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical profile of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a tertiary care hospital and alpha fetoprotein correlation (AFP) with radiological tumor size. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted from February 2023 to August 2024. There were 57 cases of HCC enrolled. Patient details were noted, such as demographics, clinical characteristics, tumor characteristics, disease severity and their treatment. The data was compiled and analyzed. The outcome measures were association of tumor size with AFP levels. RESULTS: Patients had a mean age of 63.1 years and a BMI of 27.02 kg/m(2). Common risk factors were diabetes mellitus and alcohol in 47.4% and 43.9%, respectively. The common symptoms were abdominal pain (right hypochondrium) in 40 (70.2%) patients, abdominal distension in 36 (63.2%), jaundice in 19 (33.3%), weight loss in 10 (17.5%), fever in 8 (14.0%). Hepatomegaly was present in 29 (50.9%) patients, ascites in 27 (47.4%), splenomegaly in 10 (17.5%), liver bruit and pleural effusion in 6 (10.5%) patients each, and hepatic encephalopathy in 4 (7.0%) patients. CONCLUSION: HCC patients were primarily older men with diabetes and alcohol being common risk factors. Abdominal pain and distention remain common findings with complications of cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and pleural effusion. AFP levels and imaging modalities were the most important aids for the diagnosis, management and prognosis. Majority of the treatment remains supportive in the form of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), transarterial radioembolization (TARE), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) etc. with few cases demanding interventional therapies.",2025 Jun

40655376,"Antibacterial Activity, Phytochemical Analysis of C. coggygria Leaf Extracts Against S. typhi, and Computational Studies to Screen Potential Drug Candidates.","Typhoid fever is a serious infectious disease caused by Salmonella typhi and Salmonella Paratyphi A. Although there are several drugs available for the treatment of Salmonella infection, however, the rising cases of bacterial resistance against common drugs necessitate new drug discovery against S. typhi. So Typhoid fever can be managed in a better way. Therefore we carried out the phytochemical analysis of Cotinus coggygria by FTIR and GC-MS analysis followed by antibacterial activity against S. typhi. Moreover, We also conducted molecular docking to find out important phytochemicals; methanol (48 compounds) and ethyl acetate (66 compounds) and 6 molecular targets; glycosidehydrolase (PDB Id: 4hzm), OmpF (PDB Id; 4kra), DNA gyrase (PDB Id;5ZTJ), AvrA (PDB Id; 6BE0), RamR (PDB Id; 6IE9), and tryptophan Synthase (PDB Id; 7L03). Results show that the ethyl acetate extracts of C. coggygria have the highest antibacterial activity against S. typhi, with inhibition zones ranging from 23 +/- 2.8 to 18 +/- 0.5 mm at different concentrations as compared to methanol extracts. Based on the docking score, DNA gyrase (5ZTJ) was found as the most suitable molecular target. DNA gyrase (5ZTJ). Further molecular dynamics simulation study resulted in 7 potential inhibitors from ethyl acetate extract and 5 potential inhibitors from methanol extracts as they had lower free binding energy than the reference drug ciprofloxacin. Based on this study we conclude that the top four phytochemicals that may be used for therapeutic purposes and drug development against salmonella activity are Lanosterol, Lup-20(29)-en-3-one, 9,19-Cyclolanost-24-en-3-ol, (3. beta.)-), and Periplogenin acetate.",2025 Jun
40652474,"Neurological Manifestations of Scrub Typhus: The Clinical Spectrum, Determinants, and Outcome.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neurological involvement is reported in up to a quarter of patients with scrub typhus. However, prospective studies accurately describing clinical findings, temporal evolution, and rare syndromes are sparse. This study characterized scrub typhus-associated neurological syndromes, emphasizing neurological localization, clinical outcomes, and potential predictors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients admitted to a medical college hospital with scrub typhus during a 1-year period. Detailed clinical, laboratory, and radiological profiles and outcomes were documented and analyzed. RESULTS: Among 198 patients included, whose median age was 47 years (range, 18-85 years), 48.5% were men. The mean duration of fever before presentation was 8.2 days. Neurological deficits attributable to scrub typhus were present in 31.3% of patients. The commonest syndrome was meningitis/meningoencephalitis (87.9%). Extrapyramidal disorders occurred in 10%, and cerebellar disorders occurred in 3%. Extrapyramidal disorders often developed during the acute stage and persisted into early convalescence. Ischemic stroke and new-onset peripheral neuropathies occurred in two and three patients, respectively. Parameters in patients with and without neurological manifestations were compared. Multivariate analysis revealed that male sex, headache, vomiting, and elevated creatinine increased the odds of neurological involvement. Myalgia and tachycardia reduced the odds of neurological disease. Overall mortality was 6.1%. Neurological involvement was not associated with poor outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological involvement was present in nearly one-third of patients with scrub typhus, with meningoencephalitis being the most common manifestation. Headache, vomiting, and elevated creatinine predicted neurological involvement, while myalgia and tachycardia were negatively associated.",2025 Jan 1

40646441,"Acute undifferentiated febrile illness in a traveler returning from Burkina Faso, West Africa to Puducherry, India- a case report.","BACKGROUND: Imported malaria remains a significant diagnostic challenge, particularly in regions approaching elimination. This case report is novel in its exploration of the complexities involved in diagnosing malaria imported from a high-endemic area to a low-endemic region, emphasizing the critical role of detailed travel history and molecular diagnostics in identifying the disease. The case underscores the potential public health implications of missing such diagnoses in regions where routine malaria testing is not performed due to low endemicity. CASE PRESENTATION: A 25-year-old male presented to a tertiary care hospital in Puducherry, India, with symptoms of intermittent fever, headache, loss of appetite, and vomiting, which persisted over a week. Initial laboratory findings showed thrombocytopenia and leukopenia, with negative tests for dengue, chikungunya, and scrub typhus. Further investigation using molecular diagnostic techniques identified Plasmodium falciparum. The patient had recently returned from Burkina Faso, West Africa, where he had experienced similar episodes of fever, establishing the diagnosis of imported malaria. CONCLUSIONS: This case highlights the necessity of considering imported malaria in the differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses in India, a country nearing malaria elimination. It illustrates the importance of incorporating travel history into clinical evaluations and supports the use of molecular diagnostics to effectively diagnose malaria in settings where traditional diagnostic methods may overlook imported cases. The findings advocate for enhanced surveillance and diagnostic preparedness to manage imported cases of malaria, thereby supporting ongoing elimination efforts and preventing the re-establishment of local transmission.

40641555,Suboptimal dengue genome leverages non-canonical translation mechanisms.,"Dengue is a notable example of vector-borne RNA virus responsible for severe hemorrhagic fever. Its compact genome necessitates reliance on the host's translational machinery for replication. This study investigates the plausible adaptive strategies employed by dengue serotypes for effective translation within the human host. By analyzing viral reads from the RNA-seq dataset derived from the hospital-admitted patients, we explored the impact of dinucleotide diversity on codon optimization, and compatibility of serotypes with the host. Our findings reveal only moderate congruency of serotypes with the host and identified genomic composition common to several RNA viruses. Notably, unique coverage patterns were observed within the genome of DENV-2 serotypes. Using ribosome profileing (Ribo-seq) data, we extended our analysis to assess the translatability of potential internal open reading frames (iORFs) identified in the RNA-seq dataset. Nine common iORFs were identified across both the datasets, underscoring potential non-canonical translational mechanisms that might enhance DENV genome optimization.",2025 May 16
40640746,A comprehensive overview of patient journey and management decision pathway for myelofibrosis in India: INLAND survey.,"BACKGROUND: Myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferative and anomalous production of cytokines with genetic mutations in the JAK/STAT signalling pathway playing a distinctive role in its pathophysiology. Diagnosis of MF presents a challenge due to vague and overlapping symptoms. The present strategy for managing MF is not well defined and relies on a symptomatic approach. Ruxolitinib is the first drug approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2011. Drug Controller General of India approved Ruxolitinib in 2013 as a first-line treatment in patients with MF. This comprehensive survey aims to understand the MF patient journey and the perceptions/practices of Indian hematologists/oncologists regarding diagnosis, prognosis, and disease management of myelofibrosis. METHODS: A cross-sectional, multicentric, qualitative survey was conducted across 17 Indian cities from October 2021 to November 2021. One-on-one telephonic interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire based on the study objective. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the obtained data. RESULTS: Overall, 50 physicians and 154 patients (primary MF: 51, post-PV: 78 and post-ET: 25) completed the survey. The most common symptoms reported by patients and physicians at the time of diagnosis were, abdominal pain/discomfort (81% vs. 70%), fatigue/tiredness/weakness (77% vs. 73%) and fever (54% vs. 48%). A 10-month delay was observed from the symptom onset to the final diagnosis and a further 9-month lag from final diagnosis to treatment initiation. In our survey, the physicians preferred Hydroxyurea (88%), blood transfusion (82%) and Ruxolitinib (78%) as the treatment regimen. The majority of the patients were aware of their treatment. Hydroxyurea constituted the predominant treatment option (n = 85); however, satisfaction was highest with Ruxolitinib (50%, n = 13). The physicians considered improving overall survival as an important treatment goal, while patients prioritized symptom relief. CONCLUSION: The survey highlights the importance of understanding symptom burden and treatment goal perceptions in shaping management decisions. The results emphasize the need to align the physicians and patients on the actual treatment outcomes through patient education. Strengthening this alignment will enhance treatment adherence, improve patient satisfaction, and ensure better clinical outcomes, ultimately leading to a more patient-centred approach to managing the disease.",2025 Jul 10
40639366,"Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and Activity of AT-752, a Novel Nucleotide Prodrug with Pan-Serotype Activity against Dengue Virus: A Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind Study.","AT-752 is a novel guanosine nucleotide prodrug inhibitor with pan-serotype antiviral activity against dengue virus. In this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the activity, safety, and pharmacokinetics of oral AT-752 (750 mg thrice daily for 5 days) compared with a placebo in 21 adults with confirmed dengue infection. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in viral load via reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction testing, with assessments performed daily on Days 1-8, 14, and 28. The primary endpoint was nonevaluable because many patients presented late during the course of disease, with low baseline viremia levels precluding accurate quantification at subsequent timepoints. In the as-treated population (patients with assessment at baseline and at each post-baseline timepoint), the numerical mean reduction (versus baseline) in viral load on Day 4 was greater in the AT-752 group than the placebo group (P = 0.0022). The median time to a sustained resolution of fever (the major clinical sign of dengue) was 4 days in the AT-752 group compared with >5 days in the placebo group; the reduction in oral temperature at the Day 4 timepoint was greater in the AT-752 group (treatment difference: 0.84 degrees C; P = 0.0322). There was a trend toward faster platelet recovery in the AT-752 group compared with the placebo group, and proportionally fewer patients in the AT-752 group underwent hospitalization for disease progression (one patient in each group). AT-752 exhibited favorable safety and tolerability; the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate, and Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred at similar rates in both groups. These data support the further evaluation of AT-752 in treating dengue in future clinical trials.",2025 Jul 10
40636747,Acute interstitial pancreatitis with Burkholderia cenocepacia pseudocyst in an immunocompetent host: A case report on an atypical presentation and review of literature.,"We report an atypical occurrence of a Burkholderia cenocepacia-infected pancreatic pseudocyst in an immunocompetent patient. A 24-year-old male presented to the clinic with a history of sudden-onset intermittent abdominal pain and fever for the past 3 days. Examination found a soft abdomen, with epigastric and left lumbar tenderness with guarding. An abdominal ultrasound revealed a gaseous abdomen with mild hepatosplenomegaly and three anechoic collections in the pancreas with septations, suspected to be pseudocysts in the uncinate process and body of the pancreas. A pigtail catheter was inserted to drain the pus-filled cyst, and the fluid culture was positive for ceftazidime-sensitive Burkholderia cenocepacia using MALDI-TOF of growth from culture in blood and McConkey agar. The regimen of Inj Ceftazidime for 21 days was started. A pigtail catheter was used to drain the pancreatic collection till the drained fluid was less than 10 mL for 3 days. The patient was discharged in good condition. This case presents an uncommon presentation of Burkholderia cepacia complex infection in a pseudocyst, particularly in an immunocompetent host, which provides a unique insight into the novel properties of the bacteria, including elevated endotoxin-like lipopolysaccharide activity, which is essential in the pathogenesis in this case or similar presentations.",2025
40636170,Challenging trends in clinical-epidemiology and sero-prevalence of leptospirosis among febrile patients.,"Leptospirosis is the most prevalent zoonotic illness that affects both humans and animals worldwide. It is typically underreported due to a lack of knowledge, unusual manifestations and a lack of diagnostic resources. Therefore, it is of interest to estimate the seroprevalence of Leptospirosis from an acute febrile illness patient at a tertiary care hospital in India. Hence, a total of 252 blood samples were collected out of which 39 (15.47%) were positive for leptospirosis IgM antibody. Male patient (56.75%) shows preponderance over females. Further patients among the age group groups 21-40 (56.41%) showed the positivity. A clinical presentation such as Fever (100%), Myalgia (51.5%) and Headache (36.98%) was the most common symptoms seen followed by vomiting and abdominal pain. Leptospirosis screening must therefore be introduced as differential diagnosis in individuals with acute fever in addition to other routine testing in order to lower the morbidity and mortality.",2025
40636068,Efficacy of prophylactic enteral bromocriptine in reducing the neurogenic fever in severe traumatic brain injury patients in the trauma intensive care unit - A randomized placebo-controlled study.,"INTRODUCTION: Neurogenic fever (NF) is a noninfectious, centrally mediated hyperthermia seen in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other neurological conditions. Fever exacerbates secondary brain injury, increases metabolic demand, and worsens patient outcomes. Dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine, which modulate hypothalamic thermoregulation, have been proposed as potential therapeutic agents. This study evaluates the efficacy of prophylactic bromocriptine in preventing NF in patients with severe TBI. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 100 adult patients with isolated severe TBI admitted within 24 h of injury were assigned to receive either bromocriptine (5 mg twice daily, n = 50) or placebo (n = 50) through enteral administration. NF was defined as a temperature >38.3 degrees C for at least one episode over 2 consecutive days after excluding infectious causes. The primary outcome was NF incidence. Secondary outcomes included fever severity, frequency, onset, mortality, and heart rate-temperature correlation. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistical methods. RESULTS: After exclusions and dropouts, 43 patients in the bromocriptine group and 45 in the placebo group were analyzed. NF incidence was lower in the bromocriptine group (41.86%) compared to placebo (55.56%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.199). No differences were observed in fever onset, mortality, or heart rate-temperature correlation. Bromocriptine was associated with a reduction in peak temperature on day 5 (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Prophylactic bromocriptine did not significantly reduce NF incidence in severe TBI but showed trends toward lower fever severity. Further research with larger cohorts and optimized dosing is warranted.",2025 Apr-Jun
40635958,A Rare Association of Osteosclerotic and Osteolytic Lesions in an Adult Male.,"INTRODUCTION: Xanthogranulomatous osteomyelitis (XO) is a rare form of chronic osteomyelitis. (XO) is invariably pathological. This lesion tends to extend into the adjacent soft tissues, mimicking malignancy. Non-specific symptoms associated are pain at the site of involvement, fever, leukocytosis, increased C-reactive-Reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). A Hallmark feature is the presence of lipid-laden macrophages or histiocytes, with acute and chronic inflammatory cells, in the histopathology. Infective organisms are identified rarely by culture, That is, usually sterile. CASE REPORT: We discuss here a case of (XO) of the right hip joint, a 38-year-old male patient presented with right hip pain throbbing type, which was insidious in onset. Accompanying symptoms included evening rise in temperature, loss of weight, and loss of appetite. The patient had a history of trauma for which he was treated with native splinting for 3 months. The laboratory investigations showed leucocytosis, elevated CRP, and ESR. CONCLUSION: Histopathology examination is the gold standard in diagnosis as clinical and radiological findings are not so conclusive.",2025 Jul
40635932,"A Case Report of Acute on Chronic Osteomyelitis of Distal Femur Managed with Sequestrectomy, Saucerization, and Stimulan Placement.","INTRODUCTION: Osteomyelitis is a bone infection that may present acutely or chronically. Acute on chronic osteomyelitis refers to the exacerbation of symptoms in a patient with an underlying chronic infection. This case report presents a 19-year-old male diagnosed with acute on chronic osteomyelitis of the right distal femur, with no history of a discharging sinus for the past 6 months. Osteomyelitis is a bone infection commonly caused by bacteria, with Staphylococcus aureus being the most frequent pathogen. Chronic osteomyelitis can occasionally experience acute flare-ups, referred to as ""acute on chronic osteomyelitis"". This report discusses the presentation, diagnosis, and management of a 19-year-old male with acute on chronic osteomyelitis of the right distal femur. CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old male presented with increasing pain, swelling, and warmth over his right distal femur for 2 weeks. The pain was deep, throbbing, worsened by weight-bearing, and unrelieved by analgesics. He had similar complaints 6 months ago but had no symptoms such as fever or discharging sinus since then. There was no history of trauma or injury. On physical examination, the patient exhibited localized tenderness, mild swelling, broadening, irregularity, and warmth over the distal femur. Movements of the knee were restricted, and pain was elicited with direct palpation of the femur. No open wounds or discharging sinuses were present, and neurological and vascular examinations were unremarkable.Radiographs of the right femur showed sclerosis and focal cortical thickening, indicating chronic osteomyelitis. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of marrow edema, cortical irregularity, and periosteal reaction, supporting the diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis with an acute exacerbation. Blood tests revealed an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein, indicating an acute inflammatory response. The patient received intravenous antibiotics preoperatively, followed by sequestrectomy, saucerization, and stimulan placement over the site where necrotic bone was removed to promote healing. Over 6 weeks, the patient experienced significant improvement in symptoms. Repeat imaging showed resolution of the acute infection, and long-term oral antibiotics were prescribed to manage chronic osteomyelitis.This case emphasizes the challenges of diagnosing and treating acute on chronic osteomyelitis, particularly when typical signs like a discharging sinus are absent. Early diagnosis and prompt, targeted antibiotic therapy is crucial for preventing complications such as deformities, limb loss, or sepsis. CONCLUSION: Effective management of acute on chronic osteomyelitis requires comprehensive evaluation through clinical history, imaging, and laboratory testing. Early intervention with surgical debridement and appropriate antibiotic therapy is vital to achieving favorable outcomes and preventing long-term complications.",2025 Jul
40635807,Perioperative challenges and management strategies for non-cardiac surgery in patients with rheumatic heart diseases: A narrative review.,"Rheumatic heart diseases (RHDs) impose a substantial global burden, primarily affecting individuals under 25 years of age in low- and medium-income countries (LMICs) and poor and marginalized groups in high-income countries.[123] The underlying cause is a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, which triggers an immune-mediated attack on the heart and joints. Although acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is treatable, its occurrence and complications remain high in impoverished areas.[4] Variations in social structure contribute to differences in the incidence and progression of the disease, even in affluent regions.[5] Administering anesthesia to this patient population presents significant challenges, particularly when early management has been inadequate due to limited medical care and follow-up. Literature shows evidence for anesthetic management of different types of RHDs, mostly focusing on mitral and aortic valvulopathies.[67] This review synthesizes literature from databases such as MEDLINE and PubMed searches from the year 2000 to date, focusing on anesthesia management strategies and the challenges posed by ARF and RHD. Specific topics covered include the diagnosis and management of ARF, acute complications, perioperative care for patients with RHD, and unique considerations for different valvular pathologiesWith this review, we aim to discuss the available evidence, current World Health Organization (WHO) and societal guidelines in the context of perioperative medical and anesthetic management, hemodynamic challenges, and postoperative courses. An emphasis on basic point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) training is made in this review as the current era of diagnostics and therapeutics is increasingly reliant on echocardiography.",2025 Jul-Sep
40635225,An Unusual Adverse Drug Reaction to Thalidomide: A Case Report.,"BACKGROUND: Thalidomide has emerged as a novel antitumor drug with antiangiogenic and immunomodulatory properties. It was taken off the market in the early 1960s due to its infamous connection with congenital defects. Recently, the FDA approved thalidomide for treating erythema nodosum leprosum, adhering to strict guidelines and safety measures. Sensory peripheral neuropathy and teratogenicity, fatigue, vertigo, headache, gastrointestinal issues, skin eruptions, dizziness, galactorrhoea, decreased libido, and constitutional symptoms like fever, weakness, headaches, and weight loss are the main adverse effects of thalidomide. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 46-year-old female diagnosed with lepromatous leprosy on multibacillary multidrug therapy presenting with unusual adverse reactions, such as generalized burning sensation, breathlessness, and low backache after the intake of thalidomide. CONCLUSION: We describe an unusual adverse reaction to thalidomide that has not previously been reported in the literature and aim to alert clinicians about the unusual, adverse reaction as an uncommon side effect of thalidomide and to always keep in mind if the patient develops any of these symptoms.",2025 Jul 8
40632098,Acute accidental methotrexate poisoning: Fatal consequences - An Indian experience.,"Methotrexate (MTX) is a versatile drug used in various fields, including oncology and rheumatology, acting by inhibitory effects on DNA synthesis and cellular replication. While low-dose MTX is a first-line treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, overdose or incorrect dosing can lead to severe toxicity. We present three cases of accidental MTX poisoning, highlighting the diverse clinical manifestations and challenges in management. Patients presented with fever, weakness, mucocutaneous lesions, and pancytopenia, necessitating intensive care and supportive treatment. These cases underscore the importance of proper dosing, patient education, and pharmacist vigilance to prevent medication errors. Heightened awareness among clinicians is crucial to promptly recognize and manage MTX toxicity, ensuring the safe and effective use of this valuable therapeutic agent. Further research is needed to optimize dosing strategies and enhance safety measures for MTX administration.",2025 May 1
40627640,Determining genotype and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella Typhi in environmental samples by amplicon sequencing.,"BACKGROUND: Estimates of the burden of typhoid fever due to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) rely on data from clinical surveillance, which is rarely done in low income settings and is also limited by the poor sensitivity of the assays used and the reliance on health seeking by patients. Environmental surveillance for S. Typhi shed by symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in wastewater offers a sensitive surveillance tool that could help to inform burden estimates. Sequencing S. Typhi direct from wastewater concentrates has the potential to identify circulating genotypes and associated antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, supporting public health interventions such as vaccination and antimicrobial usage. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We designed a multiplex targeted amplicon sequencing protocol for genotyping and determining AMR in S. Typhi from wastewater samples, targeting SNPs that identify genotypes of interest and both chromosomal and plasmid-borne AMR. PCR products were sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION, and genotypes and AMR identified using the GenoTyphi program. We tested this approach on samples from south India from both hospital outflow and wastewater collected from the community. All samples tested were suspected to be positive for S. Typhi following quantitative PCR for ttr, tviB, and staG gene targets. Out of 110 samples tested we were able to determine a genotype and/or AMR for 8. All samples that gave a genotype call suggested a genotype consistent with those found in clinical cases in India during the same time period and produced consensus sequences that clustered with S. Typhi when included in a phylogenetic tree. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide proof of concept data for amplicon sequencing of S. Typhi in wastewater which with further optimisation could be used to complement clinical surveillance data or provide data on S. Typhi presence in the absence of clinical surveillance. This information can inform public health interventions, and the concept could be applied to other pathogens of interest for genotyping from environmental surveillance samples.",2025 Jul
40625744,GMMA-based vaccine candidates against invasive nontyphoidal salmonellosis elicit bactericidal antibodies against a panel of epidemiologically relevant Salmonellae.,"Systemic disease caused by nontyphoidal Salmonella (NTS) represents a major cause of death and morbidity, especially in young children in sub-Saharan Africa. No licensed vaccine is yet available, and an increase in antimicrobial resistance makes the development of a vaccine a global health priority. We are developing a bivalent formulation of Salmonella Typhimurium and Salmonella Enteritidis generalized modules for membrane antigens (GMMA)-based vaccine (iNTS-GMMA) and a trivalent formulation (iNTS-TCV) in which iNTS-GMMA is combined with the WHO-prequalified TYPHIBEV (Biological E, India) vaccine to prevent typhoid fever in addition to invasive NTS (iNTS) disease. Here, we measured the ability of antibodies induced by iNTS-GMMA and iNTS-TCV formulations in mice and rabbits to kill a broad panel of Salmonella in vitro in a complement-mediated fashion. These organisms include those causing invasive disease in Africa and Southeast Asia, global representatives causing gastroenteritis and other S. enterica serovars in addition to S. Typhimurium and S. Enteritidis. We characterized the O-antigen of the panel of isolates and demonstrated the sera functionality in both animal species against all isolates, providing evidence of the potential broad coverage of both GMMA-based formulations, which are currently undergoing testing in Phase I/II clinical trials.",2025
40623777,X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 1 presenting as DRESS-HLH overlap syndrome.,"A preadolescent male, born to 3rd-degree consanguineous parents, presented with persistent fever, cough and dyspnoea. He had non-resolving suppurative otitis media and two episodes of pneumonia in the past 2 years. During admission, clinical and radiological evaluations revealed bilateral lung consolidation with synpneumonic effusion. Examination also revealed the absence of bilateral tonsils. Blood and pleural fluid cultures were sterile. The child developed a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) associated with haemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytic syndrome (HLH) during the hospital stay. Given his history of recurrent infections and absent tonsils, primary immunodeficiency disorder was suspected. Immunological work-up showed reduced levels of IgG and IgM in serum. Exome sequencing identified a mutation in the SH2D1A gene confirming a diagnosis of X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome (Duncan syndrome). The child was started on regular intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, along with bacterial and fungal prophylaxis. His parents were counselled regarding the prognosis and necessity of haematopoietic stem cell transplantation as the definitive treatment.",2025 Jul 7

40622975,Chikungunya masquerading as dengue infection in Sri Lanka uncovered by metagenomics.,"INTRODUCTION: Dengue is a significant threat to human health in South and Southeast Asia where patients are treated without diagnostic confirmation during outbreaks. This approach, though cost-effective may miss important infections especially those caused by other arboviruses (e.g., Zika, Chikungunya and West Nile virus). This study aimed to diagnose missed infections mimicking dengue by using metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Total nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) was extracted and subjected to mNGS from acute infection plasma of 60 patients from a prospective cohort study in Sri Lanka in which patients with clinically suspected dengue fever were recruited but were later confirmed as dengue-negative by NS1 antigen testing and by dengue-specific reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. mNGS data revealed missed chikungunya and dengue infections in five patients each, and a possible bacterial infection by Klebsiella pneumoniae in another patient. It was not possible to differentiate chikungunya infections from dengue infections based on clinical features or routine non-diagnostic laboratory tests conducted in early infection (e.g., full blood count, C-reactive protein level). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the chikungunya sequences from this study were closely related to those sequenced from Maldives, Malaysia, India and Singapore between 2015-2019. CONCLUSIONS: Chikungunya infection may masquerade as dengue especially in low- and middle-income countries where dengue is treated based on clinical suspicion only - without confirmatory testing. As both infections are likely prevalent worldwide, but the complications and natural history of chikungunya and dengue infections are quite different, the addition of cheap and accessible diagnostics for both infections should be pursued in endemic countries.",2025
40621243,Mumps Encephalitis in a Measles Rubella (MR)-Vaccinated Child: A Rare but Preventable Complication.,"Mumps is a vaccine-preventable disease caused by the mumps virus, mainly affecting the salivary glands. It can cause serious complications, including mumps encephalitis. Despite widespread immunization practices, mumps outbreaks persist among both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations, raising issues of concern regarding herd immunity. Mumps encephalitis, although rare, can produce serious complications warranting prompt diagnosis and management. Here, in this case report, we present a five-year-old girl who presented with fever, bilateral parotid swelling, and a single episode of abnormal movement in the form of dystonia associated with fixed gaze and disorientation. The patient had received two doses of the measles rubella (MR) vaccine as per India's universal immunization program (UIP). Laboratory investigations showed high amylase levels, positive serum mumps IgM, and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis; all indicative of mumps encephalitis. Brain imaging was normal, excluding other neurological causes. Initial empirical antibiotics and acyclovir were discontinued following the diagnosis of mumps encephalitis. The patient showed improvement within 48 hours of supportive treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering mumps encephalitis in pediatric patients with mumps showing neurological symptoms. It also demonstrates the public health impact of omitting the mumps vaccine from India's UIP and the major role of the mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR) vaccination in preventing such complications.",2025 Jun
40620198,Beyond the danger triangle: Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis following a temporal forehead furuncle.,"Septic cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a rare but life-threatening complication of facial infections, typically arising from the midface 'danger triangle'. Rarely, lateral facial infections may also lead to CST through spread via deep venous pathways. We report a previously healthy adolescent boy who developed fever, bilateral orbital swelling, and painful ophthalmoplegia shortly after the resolution of a furuncle over the left temporal part of the forehead. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed CST. He was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and low molecular weight heparin, resulting in clinical recovery. This case highlights the importance of considering CST even when the primary infection lies outside the classical anatomical danger zone.",2025 Jul 7
40617070,"Clinical Profile, Intensive Care Needs, and Short-Term Outcome of Acute Necrotizing Encephalopathy of Childhood: A Retrospective Study From a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India.","BACKGROUND: Acute necrotizing encephalopathy of childhood (ANEC) is a rare parainfectious clinicoradiological syndrome characterized by rapid neurological deterioration and poor outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study over 11 years (2014-2024) in the pediatric emergency and intensive care units of a quaternary hospital in North India. Children aged one month to 12 years diagnosed with ANEC were enrolled. Data on demographics, clinical features, laboratory and neuroimaging findings, etiology, management, and outcomes were collected. The ANEC Severity Score (ANE-SS) was calculated. RESULTS: Thirty-two children were included (median age, 4 [interquartile range, 1-7] years; 53.1% male). Common clinical features included altered state of consciousness (96.9%), fever (93.7%), seizures (78.1%), and signs of raised intracranial pressure (46.9%). Organ dysfunctions included encephalopathy (100%), transaminitis (56.2%), and thrombocytopenia (46.9%). Neuroimaging revealed bilateral thalamic involvement in all cases. Etiology was identified in 37.5%, most commonly dengue virus (21.9%), followed by H1N1 (6.2%). Intensive care interventions included mechanical ventilation (56.2%) and vasoactive drugs (31.2%). Immunomodulatory therapy included methylprednisolone (78.1%), intravenous immunoglobulin (25%), and tocilizumab (15.6%). Survival rate was 78.1%. At discharge, the median Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score was 3 (3-4), indicating moderate to severe disability. High-risk ANE-SS was significantly associated with mortality (P = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: ANEC remains a severe pediatric encephalopathy with high neuromorbidity. Dengue virus was the most common trigger in this cohort. Early identification and intensive care support, along with immunomodulation, are key. ANE-SS may serve as a valuable prognostic tool.",2025 Jun 20
40615133,Dengue cerebellitis in middle childhood from South India.,"We had a girl in middle childhood, who presented with fever of 7 days duration, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, myalgia and arthralgia. The child was conscious with signs of shock. With the provisional diagnosis of dengue fever, enteric fever or scrub typhus, the child was given all supportive management. Lab investigations covering the fever panel were sent. Within 24 hours of admission, the child developed horizontal nystagmus, diplopia and intermittent dizziness. Fundus examination showed papilloedema. MRI brain showed hyperintensity of the cerebellum in T2 sections suggestive of cerebellitis. Dengue IgM antibody was positive with transaminitis and hyperferritinaemia. Child was given anti-oedema measures with supportive care. The patient recovered on day 10 of illness, and cerebellar signs subsided. Though dengue fever is commonly seen in tropical countries, the atypical presentation in the form of cerebellitis is found to be rare. The timely diagnosis helped in rapid recovery from this neurological manifestation.",2025 Jul 3
40612792,Exploring the bioactive-based therapeutic and culinary potential of Madhuca longifolia flower and delineating the research gaps in terms of scientific validation.,"The flower of Madhuca longifolia (family Sapotaceae) has a long history of traditional use in treating fever, inflammation, rheumatism, ulcers, impotence, skin ailments and heart diseases across Southeast Asia. In India, the flower is commonly consumed as a regular food item and is also used as a tonic, appetizer, galactagogue and carminative agent, particularly among rural populations residing near plantations. There are ethnopharmacological claims about several therapeutic properties and antidiabetic activities of the flower, but no scientific evidence is available on this aspect. This review aims to explore the traditional, nutraceutical and pharmacological properties of M. longifolia flowers while identifying the research gaps for establishing its therapeutic use. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on Google Scholar, PubMed, ScienceDirect, ResearchGate, Scopus, and Web of Science from 2000 to 2025. Only research and review articles were considered for analysis. Our findings present that the major bioactive compounds identified in the flower include rutin, quercetin, Mi-saponin A & B, madhucoside A & B, gallic acid and ascorbic acid. In vitro studies indicate that it has strong antioxidant activity, while in-vivo studies on animal models document hepatoprotective, anti-dyslipidemic and antidepressant properties, but these studies are miniscule. Till date no clinical trials have been conducted on the therapeutic efficacy of the flower. Although the flower is naturally rich in several bioactive compounds, its potential therapeutic properties have not been scientifically validated. Focused research is needed to extract and quantify all the key bioactives of the flower. Additionally, studies involving human participants to assess the flower's therapeutic properties are needed to bridge the gap between traditional use and modern pharmacology.",2025 Aug
40612724,"Phenotypic, genotypic characterization and antimicrobial resistance profiling of uropathogenic Escherichia coli in a tertiary care hospital, Puducherry, India.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) (UPEC) accounts for 70-95% of community-acquired urinary tract infections (UTIs) and a significant proportion of nosocomial UTIs. This study aimed to characterize the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of E. coli isolates from symptomatic UTI patients and evaluate their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hospital-based observational study was conducted at Aarupadai Veedu Medical College and Hospital, Puducherry, India, from August 2022 to April 2024. A total of 106 UPEC isolates were obtained from symptomatic UTI patients. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed using the Kirby-Bauer method, and virulence genes (hlyA, fimH, papC) were detected using PCR. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 49.7 years, with a female predominance (69.8%). Diabetes mellitus was the most common comorbidity (29.2%). Fever (60.4%) and dysuria (38.7%) were the most common symptoms. AST showed high susceptibility (>90%) to amikacin, nitrofurantoin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam, while >60% resistance was observed to cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Phenotypically, 30.2% of the isolates produced mannose-resistant hemagglutinins, and 17.9% produced hemolysin. ESBL production was found in 46.3%. Biofilm production was moderate in 65.1%, weak in 30.2% and strong in 4.7% and significantly correlated with multidrug resistance (p<0.05). Genotypically, 80.2% had fimH, 51.9% had papC and 20.8% had hlyA. papC was associated with reduced cefotaxime susceptibility (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The study highlights the significance of phenotypic and genotypic characterization in understanding UPEC virulence and resistance patterns, and emphasizes the need for targeted empiric therapy to improve UTI management.",2025 Jun
40612528,Azithromycin resistance in Salmonella Typhi: navigating diagnostic uncertainties and clinical decision-making.,"BACKGROUND: Azithromycin susceptibility testing using disc diffusion (DD) and Etests has shown discrepancies with the broth microdilution (BMD) method.

Typhi isolates (n = 353) were tested for azithromycin susceptibility as part of the Surveillance of Enteric Fever in India (SEFI), and a time-kill assay was performed using the measured MIC to assess the killing effect of azithromycin against S. Typhi isolates. RESULTS: In DD testing, false-resistance/major error was noted in 1.9% of isolates. Time-kill assay revealed slow bacteriostatic activity of azithromycin against S. Typhi isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study advocate for careful interpretation of susceptibility results and support the continued use of azithromycin in uncomplicated cases and the recommendation of combination therapy to prevent relapses.",2025 Aug
40611538,Patterns of Care and Survival of Wilms Tumor in Children in India: A Retrospective Multicentric INPHOG Study.,"Renal cancers are rare in children, accounting 6-7% of childhood tumors. In India, there is paucity of data on renal tumors including Wilms tumor (WT). AIMS: To describe the patterns of care of children with WT; 1, 3, and 5 year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). METHODS: Retrospective analysis (InPOG-WT-18-02) of data of children (<18 years) with WT from 17 pediatric-oncology centers between January 2010 and June 2021. RESULTS: A total of 404 children (male:female, 1.4:1) with WT were included in the study. The majority (74%) were less than 4 years of age (median age 27 months). The most common presentation was abdominal distension/incidental mass (91%). Other presentations (9%) included fever, weight loss, hematuria, hypertension, and others. Unilateral tumors were seen in 91.6%, bilateral tumors in 7.4%. Metastatic disease was seen in 63 (15.6%) children, common sites being lung (82.5%), liver (17.5%), and bone (6.4%). The International Society of Pediatric Oncology protocol was used in 58% of patients. Twelve children (3%) abandoned the treatment. For the remaining 392 cases, follow-up ranged from 1 to 144 months. Relapse/progression was seen in 44 children (10.9%). Mortality was 6.7%. Relapse with discontinuation of treatment was the most common cause of death (3.7%), followed by death from progression on treatment (1.3%). Treatment-related mortality was 1.7%. The 1, 3, and 5 year OS was 95.3, 92.4, and 91.5%, respectively. The 1, 3, and 5 year EFS was 91.8, 87.2, and 85.9%, respectively. Older age at diagnosis (>4 years), stage IV disease, site of metastasis other than lung, no chemotherapy, and no surgery were associated with unfavorable outcomes. CONCLUSION: A multidisciplinary approach with surgery, chemotherapy, supportive care, and radiotherapy results in good outcomes for WT in India.",2025 Sep
40601204,Climate Change and the Impact on Ocular Infectious Diseases: A Narrative Review.,"Climate change and global warming significantly affect the incidence and distribution of infectious ocular diseases. This narrative review explores how climate-related factors-including extreme weather events, precipitation, temperature fluctuations, humidity, wind patterns, ultraviolet radiation, and air pollution-can directly and indirectly influence the burden of ocular infections. By synthesizing evidence from the published literature, we examine how these environmental variables impact disease mechanisms such as pathogen survival, transmission dynamics, and host susceptibility. Increased precipitation has been associated with a higher incidence and recurrence of ocular toxoplasmosis (OT), likely due to the enhanced spread of Toxoplasma gondii oocysts through contaminated water and soil. Rainfall also creates breeding habitats for mosquitoes, facilitating the transmission of vector-borne diseases such as dengue fever and Rift Valley fever. Rising temperatures and humidity have been linked to increased rates of fungal infections, particularly fungal keratitis in tropical regions. Wind has been implicated in the airborne dispersal of pathogens, including fungal spores, T. gondii oocysts, and insect-derived particles such as moth setae, potentially contributing to OT and seasonal hyperacute panuveitis. Air pollution further exacerbates dry eye disease, which influences the vulnerability to microbial keratitis. These climate-related shifts disproportionately affect vulnerable populations-particularly those living in rural, low-income, and tropical areas. This review highlights the urgent need for further research into climate-sensitive mechanisms of ocular infections and the development of targeted adaptation strategies to mitigate their impact on global eye health.",2025 Aug
40600037,Case Report: Favorable outcome in a patient with simultaneous dengue meningoencephalitis and Wernicke's thiamine deficiency.,"This case report describes the case of a 35-year-old man with a history of chronic binge drinking who presented with fever, associated confused state of mind, and symptoms indicative of acute alcohol withdrawal, including tremors and agitation. Routine investigations revealed pancytopenia and a positive dengue NS1 antigen test, confirming a diagnosis of dengue fever. Neurological examination revealed abnormalities, such as nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia, and altered mental status, which raised the initial suspicion of an alternative diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral thalamic hyperintensities and meningeal enhancement, while the positive dengue status revealed a rare manifestation of dengue meningoencephalitis. However, owing to the patient's history of chronic alcoholism, WE could not be completely ruled out. The diagnostic challenge in distinguishing between WE and dengue-associated neurological complications is highlighted by the overlapping symptoms in this case. Furthermore, early administration of thiamine played a crucial role in managing the patient's condition, highlighting the importance of timely intervention in such complex cases marked by diagnostic uncertainties.",2025
40599955,Clinical presentation and microbial culture among osteomyelitis patients.,"Clinical presentation and microbial culture among osteomyelitis patients is required for proper diagnosis and management. Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the clinical presentation and microbial culture among osteomyelitis patients. Hence, 200 patients with osteomyelitis having clinical symptoms and radiological findings were qualified for participation. Specimens such as synovial fluid, bone sequestrum, pus swabs and pus were collected aseptically and examined for microbial growth. Clinical assessment of osteomyelitis patient showed that most commonly affected bone was tibia with trauma. Inability to bear weight was commonly observed with symptoms like fever, pain, or tenderness and swelling where infection is the predisposing factor for osteomyelitis. Further, different microorganisms like Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp, etc. were found in microbial culture.",2025
40597945,Assessing myelofibrosis burden on QoL and productivity from healthcare personnel and patient perspectives in India.,"BACKGROUND: Myelofibrosis (MF), leads to variety of symptoms, significantly impacting patients' quality of life (QoL) and work productivity. Limited data exists on MF in India. This survey conducted among Indian physicians and their patients with MF evaluated patient journey, understand perceptions around symptom burden, its impact on QoL, and management. METHODS: This cross-sectional and multicentric survey between October to November 2021 across 17 cities was conducted using a structured questionnaire based on certain identified themes (symptom burden, QoL parameters, treatment goals and patient communication) during one-on-one telephonic interview. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Fifty physicians and 154 patients (primary MF: 51, post-PV: 78, post-ET: 25) participated. Diagnostic delay of 10 months from symptom onset was noted. 151 (98%) patients reported reduced QoL and loss of work productivity. Majority of the patients (56%) reported a negative impact on work productivity, with 76% confirming that MF hindered their work-related daily activities and 42% having reduced work hours. Key symptoms included abdominal pain (patients: 81%, physicians: 70%), fatigue (77% vs. 73%), and fever (54% vs. 48%). Patient-physician perception discrepancies on QoL factors were notable, particularly bone pain (12% vs. 64%), sleep difficulties (8% vs. 70%), sexual problems (2% vs. 78%), depression (4% vs. 63%), and inactivity (4% vs. 66%). CONCLUSION: The study results highlight the negative impact of MF on work productivity by hampering their work-related daily activities and reducing the work hours. The findings underscore the significance of enhancing patient-physician communication and standardizing monitoring practices for improving care outcomes.

40596648,"A comprehensive overview of the burden, prevention, and therapeutic aspects of arboviral diseases in India.","Outbreaks of arboviruses have become one of the major and consistent health burdens in India. With no effective vaccines or antivirals, it is challenging to control the exponential increase in cases of arboviral diseases. Accurate assessment of cases, timely and accurate diagnosis, treatment, tracking fatalities, surveillance of vectors, adopting integrated vector management policies, real-time genomic surveillance, and relating these to symptoms and tracking transmission are essential for keeping the emergence of arboviruses in check. This comprehensive review explores current literature and potential curative perspectives, focusing on major arboviruses, including dengue, chikungunya, Japanese encephalitis, Zika, Kyasanur forest disease, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, and advancements in diagnosis, treatment protocols, supportive care, and the development of preventive measures. We aim to provide a thorough understanding of their epidemiology and impact in India, while identifying research and policy gaps that will enable policymakers to design effective strategies for managing the impact of arboviral diseases.",2025 Jul 1

40591236,Masquerading as lymphoma: the accelerated phase of Chediak-Higashi syndrome and its novel mutation.,"Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. The clinical presentation may be fatal if these patients develop the catastrophic accelerated phase, i.e., hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). We report a 2.5-year boy that presented to us with complaints of fever, recurrent cough, glandular neck swelling, and abdominal distension for 6 months. He also had a history of female sibling death (age, 3 years) 3 years ago with similar complaints. On examination, he had light skin and silver hair along with severe pallor, generalized significant lymphadenopathy, severe acute malnutrition, and hepatosplenomegaly. Since the patient's peripheral blood smear and bone marrow showed giant primary azurophilic granules in lymphocytes and eosinophils and the presence of 5 out of 8 HLH 2004 criteria, i.e., fever, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hypertriglyceridemia, a diagnosis of CHS with HLH was made. However, no hemophagocytosis was observed. A novel homozygous nonsense variant in exon 45 of the LYST gene (chr1:g.235702929G > A) similar to the one found in the elder female sibling and previously reported ""likely pathogenic"" was discovered, which was identified through genetic testing. This case highlights the importance of genetic testing in diagnosis as well as antenatal counselling.",2025 Jul 1
40588301,Visceral leishmaniasis concealed under a diagnosis of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.,"Diagnosing secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH) requires a systematic approach to avoid the potentially fatal consequences. A young man in his 30s, residing in the northwestern part of India, presented to us with fever, poor appetite and weight loss for over 3 months. Primary evaluation at a regional hospital showed that the patient was having hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. The treating team considered a diagnosis of primary HLH and treated him with an etoposide-based regimen. Because of the rapid clinical deterioration and non-responsiveness to therapy, he was referred to our centre. We pursued the possibility of sHLH and repeated a bone marrow examination, which showed Leishmania donovani bodies with haemophagocytosis. Thereafter, the patient was prescribed liposomal amphotericin B, but unfortunately, he succumbed to the illness. This case reiterates that infection is a frequent trigger of sHLH. The diagnosis of primary HLH in adults should be considered only after excluding all putative infectious causes, particularly in tropical regions.",2025 Jun 30
40587274,Candida parapsilosis endocarditis in a patient with liver transplantation.,"Infective endocarditis (IE) is caused by viral, bacterial or fungal pathogens, with high morbidity and mortality. Fungal endocarditis is rare and is associated with severe complications with poor prognosis despite combined medical and surgical treatment. Although Candida albicans is the most common fungal agent of this severe form of endocarditis, Candida parapsilosis is the most common non-albicans causative species. A 17-year-old patient who had had a liver transplant was referred to our paediatric cardiovascular surgery ward with a diagnosis of right heart failure. He had had coronary artery bypass graft and aortic valve replacement in 2021. He came to the outpatient clinic with complaints of fever, weakness, nausea and vomiting. On physical examination, he had pallor, dyspnoea and tachycardia. His fever was 38  degrees C and a grade 2/6 systolic ejection murmur was detected on auscultation. Amphotericin B in a dose of 4 mg/kg/day was started based on the antifungal sensitivity test.",2025 Mar-Apr

We present the case of a 35-year-old male with dengue fever complicated by acute, painful vision loss in the right eye and was diagnosed with acute congestive glaucoma leading to panophthalmitis. Timely diagnosis and prompt intervention in the form of enucleation of the affected eye saved his vision in the unaffected left eye.",2025 Jun 30
40587017,Does suction in Mini PCNL mitigate rise in intrarenal pressure? A prospective randomised study.,"The rise in intra-renal pressure during Mini PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotripsy) potentially leads to pyelovenous backflow and infectious complications. This prospective randomized study compares intra-renal pressure (IRP) in patients undergoing Mini PCNL (mPCNL) procedure with and without suction for renal stones. Suction mPCNL is expected to lower IRP by continuously aspirating irrigation fluid and stone fragments, thereby enhancing procedural safety. A total of 100 patients with kidney stones measuring 1-4 cm were randomized into two groups: Mini PCNL with suction (n = 50) and Mini PCNL without suction (n = 50). IRP was measured using a pressure transducer connected to a ureteral catheter. Key outcome measures included intra-renal pressure, stone-free rate, operative time, and complication rates. The suction mPCNL group demonstrated a significantly lower IRP (16.92 +/- 2.93 mmHg) compared to the non-suction group (19.48 +/- 4.77 mmHg, p = 0.002). The suction group also experienced shorter mean operative times (35.98 +/- 14.10 min vs. 47.12 +/- 15.36 min, p = 0.001) and lithotripsy times (19.50 +/- 11.70 min vs. 26.24 +/- 10.49 min, p = 0.003). The stone-free rate was higher in the suction group though this difference was not statistically significant. Likewise, the complication rates, including postoperative infection rates (fever and urosepsis) showed a downward trend in the suction group, however the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Suction mPCNL effectively reduces IRP, shortens operative time, maintains a comparable stone-free rate, making it a safer and more efficient alternative to traditional mPCNL. This study highlights the potential advantages of integrating suction mechanisms to control IRP and improve patient outcomes in PCNL procedures.",2025 Jun 30
